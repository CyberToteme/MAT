SATD	 todo mvw why this not done gef 
SATD	 todo this temporary crutch use until all figs are updated use the constructor that accepts diagramsettings object 
SATD	 todo there cyclic dependency between and figedgemodelelement 
SATD	 todo need rethrow this some other exception type but that too much change for the moment 
SATD	 todo its probably worthwhile abstract and factor this chooser and directory stuff more file handling coming sure 
SATD	 todo complete this implementation tfm 
SATD	 todo this will vary based the type the tagdefinition 
SATD	 setfontfamilydialog todo this needed 
SATD	 todo move this into the toolbar project 
SATD	 todo this temporary method making sure the model updated loss focus combo box the long term should attempt update the model each keypress see 
SATD	 these methods are based the graphevents these need replacing more specic meaningful requests the diagram interface model 
SATD	 todo all super constrcutors should take graphmodel 
SATD	 workaround for missing ability parse 
SATD	 todo needs tidied after stable release graph model should created constructor 
SATD	 this wrongly called with null handle workaround return empty collection 
SATD	 todo not navigable this direction tfm 
SATD	 todo this doesnt look right review tfm 
SATD	 return the statemachine todo this method called any the figs will introduce dependency cycle would much better they could just use link which does the same thing 
SATD	 todo need clean objecttoid can based modelelement delete notifications 
SATD	 the constructor todo why does this method not handle all settings missing 
SATD	 todo performance critical method 
SATD	 todo needs work must determine which figs enclosed the pool are within the bounds this fig and translate those 
SATD	 todo optimize for root model case tfm 
SATD	 todo really need this carried over from old behavior 
SATD	 todo elementownership not modelsubsys 
SATD	 todo this seems like brute force workaround and very indirect one that appears needed though until fix the problem properly tfm 
SATD	 todo this really needed 
SATD	 todo uml spec requires both client and supplier the same model tfm 
SATD	 todo unused 
SATD	 these may not actually make any difference present the code behind addtrigger needs more work 
SATD	 todo temporary let tree expand implicitly tfm 
SATD	 todo split into inherited attr critic and local attr critic 
SATD	 todo should throw the string not good 
SATD	 todo handle multiple top level packages 
SATD	 wizard which adjust the threshold for critics todo make the treshold setting adjustable without using the wizard and make persistent maybe using the configure button the browse critics dialog see author mkl 
SATD	 todo better wrap profileexception and throw that 
SATD	 create our bandbuffer which just small slice the image todo used fixed height buffer now but could smarter and compute height which would fit some memory budget allowing use taller buffers with narrower images minimizing the overhead multiple rendering passes 
SATD	 todo support iterate declarator 
SATD	 return returns the default stereotype view todo enumeration here 
SATD	 todo how about figassociationclass 
SATD	 todo this shouldnt depend the current project but for now just make sure its defined and that have undo manager 
SATD	 remove this diagram from existence todo move gef 
SATD	 todo this needs managing undo perproject basis instead using gefs global undo manager 
SATD	 todo define constants for magic numbers 
SATD	 this class gives critics access parts the uml model the design defines gen function that returns the children any given part the uml model basically goes from project models modelelements argos critic agency uses this apply critics where appropriate todo this thinks knows all the composition associations the the uml metamodel but incomplete and not updated for uml this should done using information from the metamodel rather than hardwired code tfm see see author jrobbins 
SATD	 todo consider inherited associations todo self loops are double counted 
SATD	 todo multiple associations between the same pair elements need special cased that they dont overlap tfm 
SATD	 gets the current threshold todo should this protected return the current threshold 
SATD	 todo there cyclic dependency between this class and figconcurrentregion 
SATD	 todo move mmutil some other common place and merge with 
SATD	 needs more work sending and receiving icons 
SATD	 object tagged being the owner figedgenote has knowledge about the source and destination the figedgenote the source and destination are modelelements least one them comment but they may both comments todo theres tons special case code scattered around argouml for this one class since the only owner figedgemodelelement which not uml element should find way generalize thisp todo issue requires this class replaced similar mechanism the nary association class the node and the edges shall all have the same owner the uml comment object since jul author 
SATD	 todo offenders need more strongly typed tfm 
SATD	 expression implements one the combobox select todo euml module project 
SATD	 return the set offenders todo the return value needs more strongly typed tfm 
SATD	 todo all these classes need their own files public 
SATD	 must overridden make sense didnt want make abstract because might not required 
SATD	 todo should fire its own event and projectbrowser should register listener 
SATD	 todo use default value appropriate type for 
SATD	 our superclass longer has this method perhaps this whole thing should removed tfm 
SATD	 todo this actually hack some diagram types like the statechart diagrams access the current diagram get some info this might cause problems theres another statechart diagram active remove the current project before loading the new one 
SATD	 the following specifically for realizations todo correction gef should use not abstraction 
SATD	 todo still not used because argouml string hardwired 
SATD	 todo uml tagdefinition has become property stereotype anything that uses this will probably need reviewedchanged just return property for now 
SATD	 language must unique todo the model dont use the dialog and change the first 
SATD	 todo cyclic dependency between persistancemanager and here 
SATD	 todo this should not instance variable should just created and discarded needed 
SATD	 check for duplicate name and rename necessary 
SATD	 creates new ocl critic param oclconstraint ocl expression param headline headline param description description param moreinfourl the info url param knowledgetypes the knowledge types param supporteddecisions the decisions param priority the priority throws invalidoclexception the ocl not valid todo these need lists can they simple collections 
SATD	 todo why this inside block forgotten else branch question euluis 
SATD	 todo maybe separate name 
SATD	 todo minimal update strategy would better here minimize work and events firing but may better deprecate the method and force calls manage updates themselves since they probably usually want just add remove single element tfm 
SATD	 todo what progressmgr used here where does come from 
SATD	 todo here should show the user message that the loaded project was using notation that not currently available and fall back the default notation was done maybe this can implemented the persistencemanager 
SATD	 todo this the same parent remove see 
SATD	 todo move magic number descriptive constant 
SATD	 todo should handle access and import here 
SATD	 todo remove when code below characters removed private static final string returnstring

SATD	 todo can find better way this than hard coding colour 
SATD	 todo theres cyclic dependency between figconcurrentregion and the actions 
SATD	 public object getgoalinfostring goal return todo need better representation goals 
SATD	 local variables what they 
SATD	 todo really should separate class 
SATD	 modelelement has been changed now give priority checked the critics asap todo why synchronised todo what about when objects are first created param the design material param reason the reason 
SATD	 todo could generalize this initialize more stuff needed 
SATD	 todo why this here who calling this see 
SATD	 todo this probably belongs with the diagram subsystem 
SATD	 todo change this use undomanager instance per project when gef has been enhanced 
SATD	 hack for items only should check isleafnode but that includes empty folders really need alwaysleafnode 
SATD	 todo why was this next line the code long 
SATD	 this method has insufficient information call buildextensionpoint thus well need create one and pray that whomever called knows what kind mess they got 
SATD	 todo need set the input encoding here was done for todo parsing but none the other member types inputsource inputsource new inputsource new argo getencoding 
SATD	 todo why this not executed remove not needed tfm 
SATD	 loads project displaying nice progressmonitor param file the project opened param showui whether show the gui not todo this needs refactored gui independent tfm 
SATD	 todo this doesnt belong here but its not good time move find someplace less obtrusive than this inner loop tfm 
SATD	 todo asargument 
SATD	 todo what does the magic number represent here put explanatory literal tfm 
SATD	 todo this creates dependency the critics subsystem instead that subsystem should register its desired menus and actions 
SATD	 todo get rid magic numbers figure out which represent line widths padding offsets 
SATD	 references actions that need for mac hack

SATD	 andreas just temporary for the uml prealpha versions 
SATD	 now get all classifiers imported from other packages todo this should probably happen automatically tfm 
SATD	 todo add open most recent project command that command state can decoupled from user settings 
SATD	 install the trap eat securityexceptions note this temporary and will away future release 
SATD	 todo what are these magic numbers 
SATD	 create taggedvalue with tagtype matching our source module filename and value the files last modified timestamp todo this functionality needs moved someplace useful its needed otherwise can deleted tfm 
SATD	 choose the arrowhead style for each end todo this called from paint would not better called from renderingchanged 
SATD	 todo why isnt this stuff managed the namefig itself 
SATD	 andreas just temporary warning dialog for uml 
SATD	 todo this class should moved package 
SATD	 classifier role must return the sent messages other cases returns empty list todo must the incoming messages the sent ones 
SATD	 initialize the argouml application version that link doesnt return null throws exception something goes wrong todo move this helper class 
SATD	 create enumeration return object new enumeration since uml todo this needs extra parameter specify the modelextent where the new element should created 
SATD	 todo lets move this behind the model interface 
SATD	 classifier role must return the received messages other cases returns empty list todo must the outgoing messages the received ones 
SATD	 argoeventpump event dispatcher which handles events that are global nature for the entire application todo diagramappearance and notation events are not applicationwide and will moved from here someplace more specific the future that they can managed perproject perdiagram basis 
SATD	 create empty but initialized instance uml node return initialized uml node instance todo this needs extra parameter specify the modelextent where the new element should created 
SATD	 todo once have fixed all subclasses the title will always localized this localization can removed 
SATD	 get the classifier participant associationend todo rename this getparticipant align with uml spec tfm param handle the associationend get from return the classifier the associationend

SATD	 todo actionstate callstate and subactivitystate have been replaced uml explicitly modeled actions 
SATD	 todo silently ignore instead return false 
SATD	 find the icon for given model element return the icon codenullcode there icon param value the model element todo this should not use string matching classnames this since this means that have knowledge about how the model elements are implemented outside the model component 
SATD	 initialze gefs version the loader too todo should probably passing icons that loaded ourselves but there doesnt seem way that with gef tfm 
SATD	 return the key tag some tagged value todo this does exactly the same gettagobject remove one them param handle the tagged value return the found value string 
SATD	 todo lots more types duration instance interval 
SATD	 todo can get this from the metamodel nonnls 
SATD	 todo how get the connectors association 
SATD	 todo remove cant localized 
SATD	 classifier can only have single unnamed classifierrole todo this probably belongs critic instead here 
SATD	 the part the design this issue affects each member either model element link fig link diagram todo offenders need more strongly typed because there not common supertype for these three types cant type this list should introduce common supertypeinterface tfm the list offenders set once the constructor and cannot change 
SATD	 reply set design materials that are the subject this todoitem return the offenders todo offenders need more strongly typed tfm 
SATD	 todo this could huge collection find more efficient way 
SATD	 todo generalize assumes uml type names are unique without the qualifying package names true for uml 
SATD	 models the designers goals making this design provides useful control information the agency that only critics relevant the designers goals are ever executed todo really this should part domain extension and not the kernel have not developed this part argo very much author jason robbins 
SATD	 todo need worry about umlclass umlpackage etc 
SATD	 todo this should fetch the stereotype from our profile 
SATD	 todo encountering deleted object during any part this traversal will abort the rest the traversal probably should the whole traversal single mdr transaction

SATD	 todo this references the concrete factory need factories factory 
SATD	 set the target anew todo this method never used what its intention remove 
SATD	 todo this first loop just count the items appears redundant tfm 
SATD	 create new panel for the given step for example when the given step create the first step the wizard todo might convient make reusable subclass wizard that shows all textual steps guide the user without any automation such wizard could easily authored stored xml file and efficiently presented reusing single panel with single jtextarea param newstep the number the step make panel for return new panel for the given step 
SATD	 todo tabtodo should listen for event that this fires that can decouple from the projectbrowser tfm 
SATD	 todo this using internal knowledge gef should handle this itself tfm 
SATD	 copy file from source destination todo perhaps belongs utilities class some sort param source the source file copied param dest the destination file return success status flag 
SATD	 todo this using internal knowledge gef should handle this itself tfm mvw move into something like maininitgef 
SATD	 for locale selectionp todo detect the available locales from the available files return locales used argouml

SATD	 moves some object trash deletes completely with all dependent structures deleting object involves pre removing target history deleting all fig representations for the object deleting the uml element deleting all dependent uml modelelements deleting commentedges which are not uml elements move trash for enclosed objects graphically drawn top move trash subdiagrams for the object saveguard that there always least diagram left the current diagram has been deleted select new one show trigger the explorer when diagram deleted set the needssave dirty flag the projectmanager pre param obj the object deleted see todo this should just named delete something which better tells what does since there really isnt trash can 
SATD	 changed uml component with subsystem stereotype todo should deprecate this 
SATD	 returns the root package return the package which the root deprecated for tfmorris use link getroots get packagesmodel elements which are the top level todo probably need getdefaultnamespace method something similar replace some uses this 
SATD	 updates the top level modelelements for all projects uml each model knows its root elements this could make setroots obsolete applying stereotype uml adds new root todo this redundant with setrootsgetroots there are already too many ways this stuff managed without adding additional one all current model subsystem implementations know their top level elements responsibility can moved the model subsystem but lets choose one way managing this 
SATD	 datastructure for settings for project most getters return string since they are used argotee this also the reason all these attributes are not part map something todo the header comment currently not used this function not completely implemented yet how store this the project where should the user enter his header comment see issue author michiel 
SATD	 notation settings value object stores settings which control how text rendered diagrams todo this needs diet its used everywhere performance sensitive the current set settings the union all those found the legacy code but its not clear that all them are actually used author tom morris tfmorrisgmailcom 
SATD	 this does calculation where our ext directory todo should eventually make sure that this calculation only present one place the code and not several 
SATD	 contrast link getzipname returns the members name without the prepended name the project but with the extension todo this not used anywhere shall remove author steffen zschaler return the members name without any prefix suffix 
SATD	 todo end with multiple models here 
SATD	 were deleting the last diagram lets create new one todo once mdi wont need this 
SATD	 create notation settings value object with all default values todo this class only has partial undo support basically just those members that had part previous implementation 
SATD	 this code was copied from 
SATD	 this the temporary solution for issue 
SATD	 parse message textual descriptionp todo this method too complex lets break param umlmessage the uml message object apply any changes param the string parse throws parseexception when detects error the attribute string see also 
SATD	 this the temporary solution for issue 
SATD	 todo addonly has been removed uml should phase out support tfm 
SATD	 save the argo entry todo cyclic dependency with persistencemanager move someplace else 
SATD	 empty then were done there cycle the message graph which would bad has more than one element then the model crappy but well just use one them anyway 
SATD	 utility method encode string way that allows saved properly xml file and regained filtering out any noice that xml framework might have seen fit add todo why are doing this ourselves surely encoding information for xml serialization well known task tfm have never understood why this being done think should remove any usage bob param str the string encode return the encoded string 
SATD	 hence less elegant workaround that works 
SATD	 this should probably inside xmireaderparse but there another place this source where xmireader used but appears the nsuml xmireader when argo xmireader used consistently can responsible for loading the listener until then here 
SATD	 critic suggest using the facade stereotype todo the moment only dummy implementation see issue 
SATD	 todo this needed 
SATD	 could this some other type internal error that want handle differently dont think tfm 
SATD	 create and register diagrams for activity and statemachines the models the project other diagrams are created default class diagram will created argouml currently requires least one diagram for proper operation todo move xmifilepersister protected param project the project 
SATD	 load xmi file before any pgml files fixme the following loading the model before anything else due the zargo containing the profiles currently have removed this hack umlfilepersister and think should removed from here also 
SATD	 bufferinputstream that aware xml structure searches for the first occurrence named tag and reads only the data inclusively from that tag the matching end tag can search for the first occurrence named tag and read the child tags the tag not expected empty tag todo this hardwired assume fixed single byte character encoding needs updated handle different encodings including multibyte encodings tfm author bob tarling 
SATD	 todo attempt move the following code gef 
SATD	 todo use stylesheet convert wait till use fig factories diagram subsystem what the last version that used fignote 
SATD	 todo move diagram subsystem 
SATD	 set the fig style attributes todo this should move into the render factories described issue param fig the fig style param attributemap map name value pairs 
SATD	 todo without this fail draw class but this good solution why the layer not set the constructor 
SATD	 todo really want able replace the initial content handler which passed sax but cant this without cloning whole bunch code because its private the super class 
SATD	 fig was created the code above then must look for the old style constructor that should have fallen into disuse now figobject rectangle diagramsettings all these constructors should have been deprecated least and replaced with the new signature this here for paranoia only until all figs have been reviewed 
SATD	 fignodemodelelement with owner should match here todo this temporary solution due figpool extending fignodemodelelement when fact should not 
SATD	 translate the visibility flag fig the pgml visibility attribute value the pgml values are hidden and shown not specified then the default return null for this prevent redundent data being written pgml todo remove gef release after will provided there param the fig return hidden nullshown 
SATD	 the file persister for the uml model todo this empty what its purpose tfm author bob tarling 
SATD	 todo not sure need this but just safe for now 
SATD	 open zipinputstream the first file found with given extension todo remove since this duplicate zipfilepersister method when have refactored the persister subsystem param url the url the zip file param ext the required extension return the zip stream positioned the required location throws ioexception there problem opening the file 
SATD	 todo this doesnt need full profilereference since uses the reader handed the constructor doesnt make much sense make its callers init the path some name which doesnt need author luis sergio oliveira euluis 
SATD	 todo seems like overkill load the model just get the display name but thats where its stored currently tfm 
SATD	 todo this appears unused its needed the model api should enhanced provide method that does this directly 
SATD	 todo this critics embedded comments actually used anyone 
SATD	 todo all this profile loadinghandling needs move someplace model subsystem probably 
SATD	 todo need specific exception type here 
SATD	 todo this profile isnt used anymore see getmodel 
SATD	 todo this absurdly long method break 
SATD	 todo this code cloned over and over again tfm 
SATD	 settings dialog tab panel for layout optionsp todo this class contains lot references orgargoumlumlui would probably better move there todo this class breaks too many dependency limitations and not used anywhere mvw disabled its functionality author linus tolke 
SATD	 todo could also support other flavors here image then you can drag modelelements directly into your wordprocessor inserted image 
SATD	 todo why isnt this done save 
SATD	 todo the following handling multiselection just local solution for the line color better find more general solution dont know its undoable this way thn 
SATD	 todo the following handling multiselection just local solution for the fill color better find more general solution dont know its undoable this way thn 
SATD	 todo need get the modelextent and package associated with the current diagram that can create the new element the right place 
SATD	 the dialog that allows the user any diagram the project doubleclicking itp this dialog not modal and can stay open while the user working the model even possible open multiple these dialogs although the purpose such useraction eludes mep todo this dialog should have multiple tabs named help diagram classifier statevertex etc which would allow the user other things than diagrams author mvw 
SATD	 todo bob says tabs that listen for target changes should register themselves not expect detailspane listen and pass the event otherwise these tabs always rely detailspane tabtodotarget and tabprops currently listen directly 
SATD	 todo some parts argouml have preliminary support for multiple details panels but currently only support the default south bottom panel 
SATD	 todo check that this correct 
SATD	 flag indicate are the main application being integrated another top level application such eclipse via the argoeclipse plugin todo this temporary measure until projectbrowser can refactored more appropriately tfm 
SATD	 try save the project param overwrite true then overwrite without asking param file the file save param pmw the progressmonitor updated return true successful todo separate this into swing specific class tfm deprecated bob tarling use 
SATD	 todo work progress here allow multiple details panes with different contents bob tarling 
SATD	 todo this causes cyclic depencency with actionsaveproject 
SATD	 todo this needs work that users can set the font size through gui preference window 
SATD	 loads project displaying nice progressmonitor param overwrite true the file going overwritten param file the target file todo separate this into swing specific class tfm param exit true exit argouml when done 
SATD	 todo bob says were looking focus change flag the start interaction this detect when focus gained prop panel field the assumption editing that field about start not good assumption need see can get rid this 
SATD	 this class represents pool swimlanes for activity diagrams this exists only act the gef style encloser other nodes the same must placed entirely within outside the boundaries this fig but cannot intersect with the boundary todo there actual model element being represented here are inheriting lot behaviour from fignodemodelelement that dont want require split fignodemodelelement separate the code that requires model element owner see issue remark mvw why not give owner instead the activitygraph the obvious candidate maybe the top state author mkl 
SATD	 manages progressmonitor dialog note users this class should use the type the interface link wherever possible maintain gui independence author todo bob says dont like the naming this class its confusing that its called window and yet not window lets rename once have hidden 
SATD	 loads the project file and opens all kinds error message windows doesnt work for some reason those cases preserves the old project param file the file open param showui true error message may shown the user false run commandline mode param pmw the progressmonitor updated not needed use null return true the file was successfully opened todo separate this into swing specific class tfm

SATD	 todo can move this knowledge behind model facade rather than have condition here 
SATD	 command set selected figs their minimum size despite its name really the minimum size selected here todo rename this class author markus klink 
SATD	 this fig never placed diagram only used the call renderer that pick list items look like diagram figs todo this fig does not represent model element and should not extend fignodemodelelement should split fignodemodelelement two one for base functionality for all nodes and one that truly for model elements 
SATD	 todo why this code even getting called for figgeneralization 
SATD	 class manage project related actions which need historically have been managed singletons todo its unclear whether all these actually have managed singletons but for now ive just moved them from projectbrowser tfm author tom morris 
SATD	 todo this shouldnt know the internal form type names but not sure what gefs predicatetype does fixing here tfm 
SATD	 todo move different class 
SATD	 hate this much even before start writing reinitialising global place where noone will see just feels wrong well here goes 
SATD	 kludge required gefs use hashmap the api todo this can removed they ever fix gef use maps 
SATD	 critique menu todo this dependency should inverted with the critics subsystem registering its desired shortcuts with tfm 
SATD	 genericargomenubar defines the menu bar for all operating systems which not explicitly ask for different kind menu bar such mac menus and the mnemonics menus and the menuitems are separated the emmenupropertiesem menu items are separated the the keys menuproperties have the following structure pre menu filename menu menufile mnemonics menus filename menumnemonic menufilemnemonic mnemonics menuitems fileflag for itemname menuitemmnemonic menuitemnewmnemonic pre todo add registration for new menu items deprecated bob tarling this class will moved and made private future use 
SATD	 forwards this event the tree model param element the modelelement changed todo this shouldnt public components desiring inform the explorer changes should send events 
SATD	 todo delete should available any combination model elements and diagrams todo shouldnt creating new instance here should hold the delete action some central place 
SATD	 adds the entry the mru list param filename the project todo this should listen for file save events rather than being called directly tfm 
SATD	 todo make sure this shouldnt into previous condition tml 
SATD	 todo shouldnt creating new instance here should hold the delete action some central place 
SATD	 the tree structure has changed significantly inform the associated tree model todo this shouldnt public components desiring inform the explorer changes should send events deprecated mvw use events instead 
SATD	 todo really only care about events which affect things that are visible the current perspective view this could tailored cut down event traffic tfm 
SATD	 the singleton instance todo why this singleton wouldnt better have exactly one for every explorer 
SATD	 todo rather than specifically ignore some item maybe would better specifically state what items are interest otherwise may still acting other events dont need 
SATD	 todo need factory pattern for goxxx classes that can determine they are required 
SATD	 todo can this made more restrictive care about any attributes other than name tfm 
SATD	 this carried over from previous implementation not sure why dont want contents package tfm 
SATD	 todo any namespace can contain other elements why dont allow this tfm 
SATD	 todo really should elementmodelelement but dont have type which portable for this 
SATD	 todo this method can replaced when argo drops support for java versions 
SATD	 see set the locale specific text for the critic headline the one liner that appears the todo pane and the critic description the detailed explanation that appears the todo tab the details pane mvw maybe can make part the constructor cruml fixme why override nobody uses 
SATD	 set the threshold todo should this protected param threshold the threshold compare 
SATD	 todo split into one critic for inherited problems and one for problems directly this class 
SATD	 todo need this generalization not named element 
SATD	 needed 
SATD	 find all the figs that visualise the given model element this layer null there none todo once gef includes this same method diagram then this can see 
SATD	 todo this uses last one wins algorithm for registration should warn factory being overwritten 
SATD	 gets font name doesnt exist configuration creates new entries configuration for appearance todo why create getter return the name the configured font 
SATD	 todo what this trying its never going get called tfm really dirty hack remove unwanted listeners 
SATD	 todo this shouldnt referencing the current project instead the appropriate undomanager should have already been retrieved from the correct project 
SATD	 todo should given undo manager use rather than looking for global one 
SATD	 todo replace the next deprecated call this case complicated the use parameters all other figs work differently 
SATD	 class display graphics for uml choice state diagram the circle todo this should really renamed figchoicestate its the last vestige the uml name author pepargouml 
SATD	 todo what this needed for tfm 
SATD	 the next lines fix the half issue there better way 
SATD	 return list gravity points around circle which enclosed the bounding box convenience method for use figinitialstate and figfinalstate todo this method not required all sub classes would seem sensible extend figstatevertex with figcirclevertex and only have the relevant concrete figs extend that and gain this functionality return list points 
SATD	 resize only when new concurrent region added changing the height todo probably shouldnt exist this class should listening for added concurrent regions and call this internally itself param the new height 
SATD	 todo arent our items always strings tfm 
SATD	 actually instanciate the netnode and fignode objects and set the global next mode modeplace todo should call super reduce code volume see 
SATD	 todo this logic may well worth moving into the model component provide similar grid the connectionsgrid 
SATD	 todo this class listen the model will able change live done the figs diagram 
SATD	 todo redo curbody should long curlanguagebutton 
SATD	 when change the type need create new initial value and display the panel todo select the same type that the current nothing 
SATD	 todo definitely dont want react addition and removal transitions cant more specific when register ourselves listener 
SATD	 the target model element umlx this the element that owns the expression umlx this the expression itself todo this makes behaviour different enough that separate subclasses should considered 
SATD	 field todo textarea textfield 
SATD	 todo rather than specifically ignore some item maybe would better specifically state what items are interest otherwise may still acting other events dont need 
SATD	 todo this can mess there are any better solution 
SATD	 todo use notify set true forward events model only one language and body fields should have this set true 
SATD	 todo this ordered list then you have add the right location 
SATD	 see todo this should reviewed see can improved with view towards removing some the overrriding methods used workarounds for differences between nsuml and mdr tfm 
SATD	 todo this redundant invocation 
SATD	 get all classifiers our model todo need the property panels have some reference the project they belong instead using deprecated functionality 
SATD	 todo copied from umldiagramrenderer get the fignode from the given layer that represents the given model element the fignode portion association class returned preference the figedge portion fignode found then figedge searched for and the fignode that acts its edge port returned param lay the layer containing the fig param modelelement the model element find presentation for return the fignode presentation the model element 
SATD	 todo build return parameter 
SATD	 todo and getallsubstates are duplicates tfm 
SATD	 todo how merge multiple inheritance necessary this currently copies the common ancestors multiple times 
SATD	 todo this cant depend projectbrowser alternate below 
SATD	 todo this composite association these will get deleted automatically the only thing need check for any additional elements that need deleted result 
SATD	 todo this wellformedness rule from uml can have parent generalization element that leaf selfparentforalls not sisleaf 
SATD	 check arguments against parameters for type and number todo perhaps move this critic instead tfm 
SATD	 todo add standard stereotype set open ended but predefined names include call create instantiate send 
SATD	 todo there anyway can determine this size runtime 
SATD	 todo taken from handle events attribute all this event handling should eventually moved the compartment fig for attributes 
SATD	 are getting events dont want filter them out todo can instruct the model event pump not send these the first place see defect param event the event 
SATD	 gets all root elements the uml repository including available profiles that are not part the current project degrades performance only returns user model roots and profiles gets all root models but root namespaces todo which best there any other way 
SATD	 todo currently coded this actually returns all behavioralfeatures which are owned classifiers contained the given namespace which slightly different then whats documented will not include any behavioralfeatures which are part the namespace but which dont have owner 
SATD	 todo performance consider instantiating this just once outside the for loops and clear this point instead 
SATD	 delete model element implements cascading delete make sure model still valid after element has been deletedp the actual deletion delegated delete methods the rest the factories for example method deleteclass exists corehelper delete methods deleteclass should only those extra actions that are necessary for the deletion the modelelement itself deleteclass should only take care things specific umlclassp the delete methods the uml factories should not called directly throughout the code calls should always refer this method and never call the deletexxx method xxxfactory directly the reason that possible call the deletexxx methods directly pure implementation detailp the implementation this method uses quite complicated ifthenelse tree this done provide optimal performance and full compliance the uml metamodel the last remark refers the fact that the uml model uses multiple inheritance several places this has taken into accountp todo the requirements the metamodel could probably better determined reflection the metamodel then each association that deleted element participates could reviewed make sure that meets the requirements and not deleted tfmp extensions and its children are not taken into account here they not require extra cleanup actions not the form call the remove method normal for all children mbase and not the form other behaviour want implement via this operation param elem the element deleted see 
SATD	 dont allow connections created from read only model element any other todo this should considered workaround only works because default place newly created relationships the namespace the fromelement the correct behavior the presence readonly elements really depends the type connection well the writeability both ends 
SATD	 array valid connections the combination connecting class and node classes must exist row this list considered valid lithe column the connecting element lithe column the from element type lithe column the element type the column optional not given then assumed the same the from element lithe existence column indicates that the connection valid one direction only todo this encodes not only what legal uml but also what argouml knows how create not all legal connections are included probably should split into two pieces legal uml here and supported argouml application someplace tfm see also issue most these are subtypes relationship which includes association dependency flow generalization extend and include dependency includes binding abstraction usage and permission associationrole and associationclass are associations the remaining items link transition associationend message are nonrelationship types which argouml treats connectionsedges 
SATD	 todo check for duplicates this possible 
SATD	 todo also have code registering for the names tagged value like derived 
SATD	 recursive method get all subtypes todo does this have scalability problem

SATD	 dont wait ourselves well deadlock todo might want throw exception here 
SATD	 todo must calculate the whole list 
SATD	 todo replace this recursive function loop like getroot 
SATD	 todo because get called each and every change event when the model state flux well often get before finish this collection the only saving grace that were called many times that the last time things should stable again and well get good set elements for the final update need better mechanism 
SATD	 updates compartment box called from updatelayout there model event effecting the and from renderingchanged all cases todo the above statement means that the entire contents the compartments are being rebuilt whenever addremove attribute operation reception detected would better have compartments listen for add and remove events and make minimum change rather than entirely rebuild remark mvw this bit exaggerated since the populate method already heavily optimized 
SATD	 todo reconfigure exception handling distinguish between errors that are possible due bad input data and those that represent unexpected processing errors 
SATD	 todo callers will need refactored work around the change the way multiplicities work tfm 
SATD	 todo some elements such generalization are longer named for transitional period well return string debug can continue but the calling code should probably fixed tfm bob says these are the comments that were same trick needed here for now 
SATD	 map which resources are readonly todo this needs managed per editingdomain 
SATD	 todo mvw would not better this code would starttexteditor not overruling mouseclicked but made this fig not editable stop from reacting keypresses anyhow this hack abusing figtext gef does not really support doubleclicking fig trigger some action 
SATD	 todo does element means all direct and indirect extending classifiers only the direct extending classifiers 
SATD	 todo this code appears designed jump the diagram containing the contents the package that was double clicked but looks like its always searching for the name main instead the package name todo but any case should delegating this work something that knows about the diagrams and they contents tfm 
SATD	 todo what the behavior this the case nested models 
SATD	 todo this returning extended elements base classes 
SATD	 todo classifier association isnt navigable this direction 
SATD	 model element has been removed from this packages namespace the fig representing that model element the same diagram this package then make sure not enclosed this package todo view the fig representing the model element should removed from the diagram yet agreed bob 
SATD	 todo seems work only with both loops check why 
SATD	 todo this needs double checked tfm 
SATD	 used pgmltee return the class name and bounds together with compartment visibility todo this not duplicate with the parent 
SATD	 this node cannot dragged and manipulated the same way other fignodes argouml actually optional child fig more precisely path item figedgemodelelement this allows the dashed edge association class connect the association edge and allows the dashed edge comment edge attach comment some other edge type gef can only attach edges nodes making this fig both node and containing child edge push the rules allow edge edge connections todo are inheriting lot functionality here that dont really require should attempt make figedgeport extend fignode author bob tarling 
SATD	 searches for stereotype just like the given stereotype all given models and their subnamespaces the given stereotype can not have its namespace set yet otherwise will returned itself todo this function should not take stereotype object parameter but name and baseclass todo currently only works for stereotypes with only one baseclass todo should only search for stereotypes owned the model object param models collection models param stereo the given stereotype return stereotype 
SATD	 finds stereotype given namespace and all those any subnamespace the given namespace returns null such stereotype found todo what stereogetname stereogetbaseclass null then you know immediately that none will found but that the correct answer currently null returned these cases todo this function should not take stereotype object parameter but name and baseclass todo currently only works for stereotypes with only one baseclass todo currently only works for stereotypes where the baseclass equal the given one inheritance does not work return the stereotype found null param the namespace param stereo the stereotype 
SATD	 creates uml model element the given type this only works for uml elements diagram contains elements another type then the responsibility the diagram manage those items and not call this method also only works for uml model elements that are represented diagrams node param elementtype the type model element build return the model element todo this needs extra parameter specify the modelextent where the new element should created 
SATD	 builds compositestate top for some statemachinep todo confusing name this method should better named param statemachine the given statemachine return mcompositestate the newly build top state see 
SATD	 todo mvw this needs rethinkingrework have the following questions why does not search for stereotype the namespace using properties and only create new stereotype will actually used why there not getstereotypestring name string baseclass edited dmst 
SATD	 todo this functionality the worn place should able call setvisible the compartment itself and then this class should react that event improvements will follow later releases hence this method should not considered stable for module developers param compartment the compartment changed param isvisible true the attribute compartment visible

SATD	 remove all items the group otherwise the model event listeners remain todo why does figgroup not this 
SATD	 todo uml classifierrole associationrole and associationendrole have been replaced the internal structure the collaboration 
SATD	 todo the above populate works but seems rather heavy here can see something like this needed though events wont manage this quick enough could make create the new child fig instance may also useful for return the new model element rather than the current void return bob 
SATD	 todo this neededcorrect for when all compartments are hidden 
SATD	 this tag set elements that are generated reference when importing set then the critics could ignore those objects they want todo this really belongs higher level utility class that uses the facades tagged value methods also needs updated use uml tagdefinition instead simple string

SATD	 todo should really set our own profile instead depending the default this depends the default profile configuration containing the type integer test properly otherwise will get created the main project defeating the purpose 
SATD	 called propertychanged when detects that stereotype has been added removed removal the fignode removes its listener that stereotype when new stereotype detected add listener todo bob says opinion shouldnt doing this here figstereotype should always listening change its owners name should always listening for add remove stereotypes its owner those classes will need pass some event the fignode the awt thread only change results change size that requires redraw pnote runs the model mdr thread param event the umlchangeevent that caused the change 
SATD	 todo want the top level package here instead the immediate parent 
SATD	 todo this creates dependency the critics subsystem need generic way for modules including our internal subsystems request addition actions the popup menu tfm

SATD	 todo this should get the containing project from the list targets not from some global 
SATD	 todo bob says this really nasty horrible hack shadowfig should not extend fignodemodelelement instead require base class fignode with common behaviour all nodes argouml shadowfig should extend that and fignodemodelelement should extend that same base class adding common functionality for fignode that represent model element see 
SATD	 window that displays exception the user cant handle any other way todo this has been partly converted generic error dialog rather than something specific exceptions this should renamed when that process complete

SATD	 sets the directory name where the profiles can found initially uml used todo intermediate solution for uml support please implement better solution param dir name the directory for the profiles 
SATD	 todo this the wrong place its not profile specific needs moved main xmi reading code tfm 
SATD	 this can made public allow others extend their own persisters 
SATD	 once all edges are connected compute route each make sure that annotations and the edge port positioned correctly only this after all edges are connected compute route requires all edges connected nodes todo would nice not have this and restore annotation positions instead

SATD	 throws saxexception when things wrong with sax throws ioexception when theres error throws when the parser finds wrong syntax todo unused 
SATD	 since this hopefully temporary solution and nobody ever looks the type notation event can simplify from sending every existing event one event only but since there catchall event defined just make one rationale reduce the number total refreshes the drawing

SATD	 reply true iff this critic relevant the goals that the designer trying achieve default all critics are relevant regardless the goalmodel really this something for controlmech compute but subclass critic encapsulates some information you may need override this method todo would like better default action but goals are typed and their values must interpreted critics they are not generic the decisionmodel param dsgr the designer return true relevant 
SATD	 todo this hack much better way doing this would not start the critic the first place 
SATD	 return true iff the given todoitem still valid and should kept the given designers todolist critics that are not enabled should always return false that their todoitems will removed subclasses critic that supply multiple offenders should always override this method default this method basically asks the critic again critique the offending object and then checks the resulting todoitem the same the one already posted this simple and works fine for lightweight critics critics that expend lot computational effort making feedback that can easily check see still holds should override this method todo maybe todoitem should carry some data make this method more efficient inheritdoc 
SATD	 the decisionmodel part the state the designer describes what types decisions design issues the designer thinking about the current time critics that are relevant those decisions are made active critics that are not relevant are made inactive todo there some notion that each decision has certain importanance certain time but have not followed through that because dont have good examples how quantify the importance decision todo right now the individual decisions are just strings maybe they should have some nonatomic structure author jason robbins 
SATD	 how much control should critics have over when they are relavant does doing that code instead declaratively limit reasoning how does using more semantically rich method calls impact componentization

SATD	 this temporary hack until the notation provider for message will able parse successfully when the sequence number missing remove this method completely then 
SATD	 todo calcbounds called selectionmanager when the fig dragged this code needed reposition any self message they are become detached from their classifier role see issue the cause the detachment not yet understood unfortunately calcbounds called from several other places the code here not optimal but the best workaround until argouml can provide its own replacement selectionmanager for sequence diagram requirements see 
SATD	 the default behaviour from figedgemodelelement not correct here see issue todo must determine what here but for now doing nothing better not sure why the super method would not work would expect that nothing the ends are already correct return true all times for now 
SATD	 create empty but initialized instance uml parameter return initialized uml parameter instance todo this needs extra parameter specify the modelextent where the new element should created 
SATD	 convert bounding box very screwy gef sometimes uses center and sometimes upper left todo gef also positions text the nominal baseline which well inside the bounding box and gives the overall size incorrectly 
SATD	 this the interface for registering interest events sent from the model componentp neither the registration unregistration nor the events themselves contain any reference the model implementation instead they use the link link deliver eventsp the reference the listener weakreference you dont need call you can just forget about your listener and eventually finalized and removed this also means that you will have keep reference your listener while active since the garbage collecting mechanism not really deterministic forgotten about listener might still receive events unless can handle them harmless way this approach should not used todo this still true does refer the nsuml implementation tfm this part the contract that established between the model subsystem and its users that not fulfilled the current implementation then the current implementation incorrect linus todo what event names the event names generated are link strings and their values and meanings are not really well documented general they are the name association end attribute the uml metamodelp here are some highlightsul liremove event sent when the element removed author linus tolke

SATD	 recognizer for modelelements with package visibility todo this method name was chosen for compatibility with the existing naming scheme but has the potential clashing with some future use param handle candidate return true handle has package visibility 
SATD	 recognizer for modelelements which have the singleton stereotype applied todo moved this out the facade someplace elese since its not model subsystem specific tfm param handle candidate return true handle singleton 
SATD	 this should moved action 
SATD	 return the tagged value with specific tag warning this method returns only the first taggedvalue found with the given name hence this method simplification the real problem and should avoided todo what should done about the above problem options are deprecate the method throw exception the name ambiguous leave the caller figure out themselves param handle the model element the tagged value belongs param name the tag name return the found tag null not found 
SATD	 todo this removed from uml 
SATD	 todo some these magic numbers probably assume line width replace with appropriate constantsvariables 
SATD	 todo this needs managed perproject permodelextent basis 
SATD	 returns all states that can recursively contained the given state todo link and link are duplicates implemented for mdr isnt clear from the javadoc usage whether they should different things this just happened because one noticed already had another method param ostate the composite state are searching the states for return collection the collection with found states 
SATD	 add path the list paths searched when looking for xmi files resolve external references with the list maintained static structure shared all instances todo its desirable have separate search paths for separate files but more work required argouml that knows how maintain separate contexts for the profiles and user models param path directory path add the search path 
SATD	 the buttons selection for stereotype todo find way hide the the figclass the created metaclass author michiel 
SATD	 changecommand that updates its label the label this command can contain the character that will replaced with information about object when the label returned todo switch this use java string formatting instead private notation author bogdan pistol 
SATD	 todo this probably related the sendevent that sending the signal but the association not navigable that direction 
SATD	 todo actionstate callstate and subactivitystate have been replaced uml explicitly modeled actions 
SATD	 todo see protected need present each subclass 
SATD	 todo dont want this once have dropped uml map uml names uml equivalents 
SATD	 todo comment rueckert dont think makes much sense query interactions from collaboration uml since this diagram does longer exist and interaction means something different uml 
SATD	 todo comment rueckert arueckertgmxnet think the handle holding the collaboration implementation should rather collaborationuse uml but workaround for now ill try get collaboration representation collaborationuse and then try get the owning classifier from there 
SATD	 todo this probably cant implemented way that will make the uml happy needs generalized uml semantics 
SATD	 todo what want use equivalent here 
SATD	 todo there option can use save our argouml version 
SATD	 todo just guess probably not right tfm return handle instanceof linkenddata 
SATD	 todo this doesnt belong the implementation specific piece tfm 
SATD	 todo the uml concept multiplicity multiplicity range has been replaced single element 
SATD	 todo not sure the semantics are exact match here between uml aggregate and uml shared 
SATD	 todo changed uml special type property 
SATD	 todo tagdefinitions are gone from uml they are now properties stereotypes 
SATD	 todo moved this out the piece tfm everything primary for now not reverse engineered 
SATD	 this keeps track the editing domain that used track all changes the model todo this probably needs set editingdomain that can manage editingdomain per project 
SATD	 todo this method mostly entirely redundant tfm 
SATD	 todo the javadoc specifies that null should returned from are null there are associations between them should return empty collection instead and the javadoc should changed 
SATD	 todo this isnt right 
SATD	 todo does element means all parents direct and indirect only the direct parents 
SATD	 todo what the purpose this why hide buttons here presumably should not assume selectionclass 
SATD	 todo currently delete the old values before setting something new this workaround issue should consider giving api get the lower and upper values that controls can listen directly those rather than the element containing those values 
SATD	 todo umlx event has parameters the event metaclass umlx corresponds the trigger metaclass umlx see uml superstructure page 
SATD	 todo this should built reflection from the metamodel tfm update for uml metamodel not replaced reflection 
SATD	 dont implement deprecated method interface 
SATD	 todo booleanexpresion removed from umlx use valuespecification 
SATD	 todo this will need adapted send undoredo commands back our consumer argouml new undo mechanism implemented for the model subsystem tfm 
SATD	 this sets the editing domain for the model editor todo probably need editingdomain per argo project that can keep the resourcesets separate 
SATD	 todo model implementation independent 
SATD	 todo mvw really look into supertypes the stereotype should looking into supertypes the baseclass 
SATD	 todo really want stereotypes from nested packages 
SATD	 todo this should call the single namespace form getstereotypeitnext stereo 
SATD	 array valid connections the combination connecting class and node classes must exist row this list considered valid lithe column the connecting element lithe column the from element type lithe column the element type lithe column optional not given then assumed the same the element lithe existence column indicates that the connection valid one direction only todo this encodes not only what legal uml but also what argouml knows how create not all legal connections are included probably should split into two pieces legal uml here and supported argouml application someplace tfm most these are subtypes relationship which includes association dependency flow generalization extend and include dependency includes binding abstraction usage and permission associationrole and associationclass are associations the remaining items link transition associationend message are nonrelationship types which argouml treats connectionsedges 
SATD	 todo can get this info from uml plugin perhaps collect all references the metamodel filter for those which represent containments and find the types either end tfm 
SATD	 todo use for transition 
SATD	 todo shouldnt actually have all this work 
SATD	 todo hook this creating new resource someplace more more appropriate perhaps createmodel better yet add new method model api create new top level projectmodelxmi file dont depend side effects 
SATD	 todo check for resource hold this and create necessary this discrepancy between mdr which does here and euml which does part setrootmodel 
SATD	 todo getsetrootmodel arent specific the model implementation they could probably moved elsewhere tfm 
SATD	 think that the synchronized access idtoobjectmaps required order respect the thread safe nature the object fixme maybe this should moved into because depends internal implementation details 
SATD	 todo can choose between something which matches uml name something that matches functionality weve chosen functionality for now but this will create name conflict during the migration process tfm 
SATD	 todo change throw exception when uses are fixed throw new nonnls 
SATD	 near clone this code works fine outside argouml but throws null pointer exception during the transform when run within argouml think its something with the class libraries being used but cant figure out what ive done simpler less efficient stepwise translation below serialtransform 
SATD	 todo bob says coding use side effect here maybe this should done clearer way but fixes seems that when loading xmi that not contained zip file then the inputstream given the argument this method cant reused the end the stream that case systemid appears nonenull this stage systemid not null recreate the inputsource 
SATD	 create temporary file for output todo should able chain this directly xmi reader 
SATD	 xmiwriter implementation for mdr this implementation clumsy because the specified writer interface wants characters while the xmiwriter wants outputstream dealing bytes could easily create writer from outputstream but the reverse not true todo the old writer based interface can removed when the deprecated removed author lmaitre 
SATD	 todo return empty collection null input throw illegalargument 
SATD	 todo iterator filter would nice here instead the mucking around with the collection 
SATD	 todo doing this violates the minimal cardinality allow least need critic warn about 
SATD	 apply profile stereotype make profile our convention hack create that stereotype instead using the uml profile 
SATD	 systemid valid url simply use todo this causes network connection attempt for profiles 
SATD	 todo make this work when the given stereotype has more than one baseclass todo currently only works for stereotypes where the baseclass equal the given one inheritance does not work 
SATD	 todo mvw really look into supertypes the stereotype should looking into supertypes the baseclass 
SATD	 todo using just the last piece the leaves the potential for name collisions two linked files have the same name different directories 
SATD	 todo this should use minimal update strategy instead removing all and then adding all tfm 
SATD	 todo what type validation can here tagtype 
SATD	 todo this can simplified just include base 
SATD	 anything not found newly created return null systemid indicating that the parent document todo this assumption will invalid ifwhen allow editing linked submodels 
SATD	 todo distinguish between deferred resolution and things which are unresolved end load and should reported user 
SATD	 todo this assumes ranges are sorted this true tfm 
SATD	 todo this adequate for finding profiles java webstart jars tfm 
SATD	 todo check whether this really needed think its left over from incomplete understanding the magicdraw composition error problem tfm 
SATD	 todo not sure whether the above better some cases but the code below better for both java web start and eclipse 
SATD	 todo this returns collection not single object this what the callers expect 
SATD	 todo this code manually processes the elementimports package but need check whether mdr already does something similar automatically part its namespace processing tfm 
SATD	 todo this has different semantics than everything else 
SATD	 todo this does not belong here use getimportedelement 
SATD	 todo rationalize this with 
SATD	 todo temporary stopgap for enumerationliteral 
SATD	 todo more required here support referencevalues 
SATD	 todo what other nonmodelelement types need handle here 
SATD	 this causes problems can make multiple return messages refer the same activator even not returning the same classifier role the activator emenates from not sure that changing the activator one message should amend any other messages but this certainly changing too many bob 
SATD	 todo this needs localized but dont have any localization capabilities the model subsystem object args typename elemname alias imported alias return translatorlocalize args 
SATD	 register listener for metamodel class and all its subclasses optionally qualified list property names todo verify that propertyevent names are legal for this class the metamodel 
SATD	 todo want construct artificial name here 
SATD	 todo implement support for types other than string 
SATD	 todo this should done after all events are delivered but leave here for now avoid last minute synchronization problems 
SATD	 only verification debug level logging todo should leave this always tfm 
SATD	 todo mvw this needs rethinkingrework have the following questions why does not search for stereotype the namespace using properties and only create new stereotype will actually used why there not getstereotypestring name string baseclass edited dmst these comments imported from nsuml implementation tfm see javalangobject javalangobject 
SATD	 todo the type the model element used type parameter the formal needs match the actual parameter that gets replaced with later this code going restrict that always being parameter which doesnt seem right but dont have time debug right now tfm 
SATD	 todo this should built reflection from the metamodel tfm update for uml metamodel not replaced reflection 
SATD	 todo this should use minimal update strategy instead removing everything and adding again tfm 
SATD	 todo this actually returns permissions with stereotypes both access and import when the spec calls for only the former but that seems give different semantics the way package imports work review see which wrong 
SATD	 todo want friend stereotypes too permission 
SATD	 todo have multiple string representations for multiplicities these should consolidated this form used orgargoumlumlreveng 
SATD	 get elementresidences todo unused should added facade tfm param handle modelelement return collection the elementresidence for this model element 
SATD	 todo this ambiguous whether should adding container resident 
SATD	 todo this should either extended support all aggreationkinds should simplifiedremoved from the api tfm 
SATD	 todo doesnt really make sense that namespace would returned part its own contents but thats the historical behavior 
SATD	 todo perhaps use hashset other collection with faster lookup performance case our callers are doing naive contains lookups 
SATD	 todo try reusing the same set every recursion 
SATD	 check that the two elements arent already linked the opposite way todo this part implementation wellformedness rule uml circular inheritance not allowed not 
SATD	 todo this part implementation wellformedness rule uml circular inheritance not allowed not 
SATD	 todo this not according the contract for this function but used several places and mvw presume that need this generally this part about drawing import permission between packages the part below about 
SATD	 todo should handle access and import 
SATD	 todo delete instances which have this their classifier should leave them since they contain much state that the user would have recreate todo delete objectflowstates which have this their type todo delete classifierinstates which have this their type 
SATD	 todo this should probably throw exception gets invalid arguments rather than just returning null 
SATD	 todo delete old multiplicity why copy using hard coded value tfm 
SATD	 todo currently implemented this expects list multiplicityranges this interface change from the nsuml implementation suspect used accept list integers tfm see 
SATD	 todo copied from umldiagramrenderer find the figs the given layer that should the source and destination and attach these either end the figedge param layer the layer look for the fignodes param newedge the edge attach 
SATD	 todo this probably not the right location for switching off the filternewlines the setting gets lost after selecting different modelelement the diagram btw see how used see issue 
SATD	 todo this can mess there are any better solution 
SATD	 the list operations shall contain all operations all classifiers contained the same package the callaction itself todo fact also should include operations imported clasifiers see 
SATD	 see documentevent todo are the methods uses 
SATD	 creates new field that selects the language for expression param expression model should shared between language and body fields param only one language and body fields should forward events model todo mvw not understand that 
SATD	 todo why need this well control why instantiated when its not always needed 
SATD	 the constructor param expressionmodel expression model should shared between language and body fields param notify set true forward events model only one language and body fields should have this set true todo mvw not understand that 
SATD	 simplify implementation list all associations found with any the classifiers represented the linked instances todo make foolproof algorithm that only allows selecting associations that create correct model also take into account nary associations and associationclasses this algo best goes the model subsystem method see 
SATD	 todo try use 
SATD	 todo use other checkbox defines argo and extends jcheckbox 
SATD	 todo consider conditional feature the xml panel def for this 
SATD	 todo really used see 
SATD	 todo bob says the reflective code following should replaced with something more specific like this commented out code this would mean need stype changed meta type object rather than string 
SATD	 todo are the methods uses 
SATD	 opaqueexpression can have body language when display user only show one body button enabled for edit other todo can import xmi have languagebody author laurent braud 
SATD	 todo have some quirk that the baseclass addition removal from steroetype comes back rather than this needs further investigation see this can made consistent 
SATD	 todo this needs work also need listen additionremoval states tofrom classifierinstate 
SATD	 todo may want restrict the list parameters which conform the following wfr parametertype ofstype parameterkind and parameterkind out parameterkind return and parameterkind inout and 
SATD	 todo should probably this processing imported elements automatically 
SATD	 todo part this copied from maybe need some subclass for common code 
SATD	 todo should really test the model instead for this but have api yet can just check the collection build the jlist control implements the list interface 
SATD	 todo 
SATD	 not needed 
SATD	 todo maybe should stop first find highest priority 
SATD	 todo how implement this method properly 
SATD	 todo 
SATD	 todo make this final asap 
SATD	 now know that this critic still valid what need figure out the corresponding todo item still valid the todo item replaced the name some offender has changed that affects its description the contents the list offenders has changed check that creating new todoitem and then verifying that looks exactly the same this really creates lot todo items that goes waste 
SATD	 todo what should here 
SATD	 the following debug line now the single most memory consuming line the whole argouml allocates approximately all memory allocated suggestions for solutions check there string method that can used instead use two calls for now linus just comment out logloglevelfine applying critic headline 
SATD	 todo why need this when can just change the font and achieve the same effect 
SATD	 todo this work should deferred until actually needed for display 
SATD	 todo removed from uml 
SATD	 todo should doing anything deleted elements this throws exception remove events skip for now tfm 
SATD	 todo implement 
SATD	 todo allow other configuration handlers 
SATD	 werent given system attempt use the url for the jar that were loaded from why tfm 
SATD	 todo register listener for target todo item changes and for new showstep requests 
SATD	 todo review priority public system has been reversed from original implementation 
SATD	 todo this shouldnt require two passes through the list tfm 
SATD	 compute which critics should active they can applied applyallcritics for given designer note setting global data the isenabled bit each critic based the needs one designer dont really support more than one designer which why each designer would support more than one designer has his own agency todo should loop over simpler list critics not compoundcritics param the designer 
SATD	 todo why this disabled always 
SATD	 todo should have image wizard some logo 
SATD	 todo these buttons for future enhancement 
SATD	 todo check type 
SATD	 todo for uml powertypes are accessed indirectly through the generalizationsets that contain generalization since nov author 
SATD	 unused currently stringbuffer taggedvaluessb 
SATD	 todo placeholder implementation until support for tracking perproject basis implemented return dirty 
SATD	 empty implementation 
SATD	 todo why this special case tfm 
SATD	 flag indicate are creating new current project todo this isnt threadsafe way doing mutual exclusion 
SATD	 todo indicate the direction 
SATD	 todo need way set the line color and width here but testdependencies thinks this creates dependency cycle fig line new argofiglinesnapx snapy snapx snapy argofiglinecolor 
SATD	 apparently this method never called 
SATD	 todo this code can removed when getcurrentproject removed 
SATD	 todo can just this every time need for else bob 
SATD	 todo tentative implementation want something that updates the list open projects just simple open and close events tfm 
SATD	 todo add empty placeholder here 
SATD	 todo needs completing stub implementation only tfm 
SATD	 todo needs 
SATD	 todo why arent throwing exception here returning null results npe and explanation why 
SATD	 todo expect association end here check more carefully tfm 
SATD	 todo this should only checking for the top level package anything all 
SATD	 use little trick find out where argo being loaded from todo use different resource here argoini unused and deprecated 
SATD	 todo placeholder implementation until support for tracking perproject basis implemented 
SATD	 todo performance drain load all classes startup time they should lazy loaded when needed instead scanning all classes for ones which implement our loadable module interface should use manifest entry special namename pattern that look for find the single main module class load here tfm 
SATD	 enable todo this default selects all modules that are found eventually would rather obey default either from the modules themselves from how they are found and also have information what modules are selected from the configuration 
SATD	 its jar clean and make look like file url 
SATD	 also show tagged values for uml todo what for uml here 
SATD	 todo mark diagramproject dirty 
SATD	 todo have any potential consumers the unversioned name outside the notation subsystem 
SATD	 the constructor todo why does this method not handle all settings 
SATD	 todo these defaults need checked against historical ones 
SATD	 todo shouldnt something here 
SATD	 todo handle parse error 
SATD	 todo this trycatch will needed once the code below improved 
SATD	 todo this name the expression language should configurable the user according the uml standard the expression language should the same for all elements one diagram uml not sensible default usually this some pseudolanguage return the name the expression language 
SATD	 todo need control separately for attributes and operations 
SATD	 need extend the that can replace the above deprecated call with something like this 
SATD	 todo this needs more work simply throw the new extension point away 
SATD	 todo find better default language todo should know the notation language since 
SATD	 todo can put the static block within the init 
SATD	 todo reuse the offender list 
SATD	 todo the next line should use buildguard but doesnt show the guard the diagram why mvw 
SATD	 todo this good way handling nested notation the following fails the tests new 
SATD	 todo this good way handling nested notation 
SATD	 todo add stereotype application ecore anytype 
SATD	 todo want isaumlelement here 
SATD	 todo any special handling for null names append will use null 
SATD	 todo this dtd doesnt exist cant tell readers look for wprintlndoctype profile system profiledtd but need line make the funky uml persister work remove this line the above uncommented 
SATD	 todo add implementation 
SATD	 todo need the project specific diagram settings here 
SATD	 ignored shouldnt have been the project the place 
SATD	 todo add recent patterns 
SATD	 todo these can not simply translated 
SATD	 todo possible use more than one variable 
SATD	 todo support other name kinds 
SATD	 todo allow zargo profile well

SATD	 xxx hypotheses qualifiers dont know 
SATD	 todo check types 
SATD	 stylepanel class which provides additional parameters for changing text elements provided gef todo 
SATD	 todo implement iterate todo implement sortedby todo implement subsequence

SATD	 todo investigate the unnamed opposite end 
SATD	 todo support real numbers 
SATD	 todo investigate abstractionmapping not the model subsystem 
SATD	 todo implement oclexpression 
SATD	 todo 
SATD	 todo check this 
SATD	 todo implement the difference between ocliskindof and oclistypeof 
SATD	 todo this should really coded the other way round only act associations which are important for representing the current perspective and only act single end the association tfm 
SATD	 todo want use the project here instead just its name 
SATD	 todo this could made more efficient working with iterators directly and creating composite iterator made all the various sub iterators 
SATD	 todo this going cause the color reset refresh 
SATD	 todo presentation 
SATD	 for tagged values use their containing modelelement since they dont have property panels their own todo may want this for other types too 
SATD	 reorder submenu todo think this requires but not sure tfm 
SATD	 empty implementation not used 
SATD	 todo add button force garbage collection 
SATD	 todo only fetch names and defer fetching panels until needed 
SATD	 hide save action during load otherwise get the appearing title bar and the save enabling models are updated todo still need this now the save enablement improved 
SATD	 todo replace the functioncall the next line once not support java any more 
SATD	 todo beautify the part this string 
SATD	 the text box containing the problem messages todo this should hidden default but accessible via details button tab provide more info the user 
SATD	 todo required 
SATD	 todo better implementation would batch events into logical groups and update the tree one time for the entire group synchronizing access the model repository that stays consistent during the query this would likely require doing the updates different thread than the event delivery thread prevent deadlocks for right now protect ourselves with trycatch blocks 
SATD	 todo the copy function not yet completely implemented will have some exceptions here and there 
SATD	 todo want all enabled tabs listen only the one that selectedvisible tfm 
SATD	 the drag gesture listener notified drag gestures recognizer the typical response initiate drag invoking dragsourcestartdrag todo find way show different image when multiple elements are dragged param draggestureevent the draggestureevent describing the gesture that has just occurred see 
SATD	 todo consider inherited attributes 
SATD	 todo support other types drag here you set the owner dragging into namespace alternative could drag states into composite states 
SATD	 returns set union all unique applicable stereotypes for given collection model elements todo this not optimized for performance param elements the given collection model elements return the set with stereotype uml objects 
SATD	 todo handle nway associations 
SATD	 todo ignore and report exception until gettop implemented 
SATD	 called after the diagram font gets changed todo need anything here see 
SATD	 dont know what otherwise 
SATD	 todo not implemented 
SATD	 have connection ends 
SATD	 todo need more specific here about what build 
SATD	 additional cleanup needed because this would not removed extdestroy 
SATD	 specialist selection class for figpartitions this ensures that all swimlanes are the same length height todo make sure that all swimlanes appear side side uml spec states separated from neighboring swimlanes vertical solid lines both sides todo allow drag the west and east edge resize both the selected fig and the fig connected that side todo show northwest and southwest handle only leftmost swimlane todo show northeast and southeast handle only rightmost swimlane author bob 
SATD	 the activity diagramp todo finish the work subactivity states 
SATD	 this may not actually make any difference present the code behind addtrigger needs more work 
SATD	 todo have anything add here 
SATD	 todo may return the following when the relocate has been implemented 
SATD	 todo before adding new region make the last region its minimum size smallest size that will still contain all enclosed 
SATD	 todo really need listening for both these events 
SATD	 todo this comparison very suspect should use equals method the code within the block fact never executed hesitate change this now will trigger code has never been used before and not aware any problems that usage may introduce think that need able find different way implement the intent here which seems correct edge drawings that should actually not allowed bob 
SATD	 todo after removing region reset the overall size the node 
SATD	 associations not supported yet todo create appropriate classdiagramedge 
SATD	 todo make another pass deal with overlaps

SATD	 todo for uml this isstatic 
SATD	 todo why need this 
SATD	 todo this needs modified for uml 
SATD	 for backward compatibility everything above and right todo polar domain 
SATD	 todo would better here continue the loop and try build the rest the compartment hence trycatch should internal the loop 
SATD	 todo why are these different colors tfm 
SATD	 todo how handle changes shadowsize from the project properties 
SATD	 todo add unnamed new something localized course 
SATD	 todo should require graphmodel the constructor since our implementations setnamespace are going try and set the namespace the graphmodel well 
SATD	 perhaps something like the following would work instead rectangle drawingarea 
SATD	 todo this must happen the awt thread 
SATD	 todo need better algorithm 
SATD	 todo use this event mechanism update the checkmark the presentation tab 
SATD	 todo this turns out performance bottleneck can probably optimize the common case caching our iterator and current position assuming that the next request will for greater index 
SATD	 assert todo really always need this only notationprovider null 
SATD	 lets test which situation have possibilities the nodes are already the diagram can use canaddedge for this one the nodes already the diagram the other has added both the nodes are not yet the diagram for the time being will only implement situation todo implement situation and 
SATD	 todo more strongly typed data structure could used here 
SATD	 perform rerouting srcdest nodes have changed pthis method needs armed previous mousedragged avoid the situation where the user just clicks the node then clicks some unrelated fig without moving the edge ptodo improve the fig finding algorithm find the top most fig the layer will useful for nested states statechart see

SATD	 todo uml what here 
SATD	 todo implement this show some documentation 
SATD	 todo these have been used for most instances new figfoox but additional work required extract the constant from calculations etc

SATD	 todo this next line prevent loading usecase with stereotype grow why 
SATD	 utility function localize the given string with help text and show the status bar the argouml window this function used favour the inline call enable later improvements would possible show helpballoon todo work this out one matter possibly improve show multiple lines param the given string localized and shown 
SATD	 compilecheckbox new jcheckbox todo implement the compile feature for now disable the checkbox borderlayoutsouth 
SATD	 save the source language the model todo support multiple languages now that have uml tagged values param node param language 
SATD	 todo this transformation java specific need more languagenotation scheme for specifying qualified names possible algorithm replace all punctuation with our internal separator replace multiple separators with single instance for languages like what about tfm 
SATD	 todo need add filechooser 
SATD	 todo this needs improved even for nongui calling the config panel needs initialized 
SATD	 todo implement additional operations 
SATD	 return the fully qualified name model element java dot separated format todo really need language independent format here perhaps the list names that form the hierarchy tfm 
SATD	 todo need uml equivalent 
SATD	 the list with objects that should shown the combobox todo using list here forces linear search when were trying add new element the model which can very slow for large models 
SATD	 generates new unique and returns string the contents the string supposed unique with respect all strings generated other instances this class todo should consider using javautiluuid for this instead return string with unique content 
SATD	 todo 
SATD	 todo add updown buttons control the ordering items 
SATD	 todo add all top level packages 
SATD	 the property that this comboboxmodel depicts changed the uml model this method will make sure that the changes will done the comboboxmodel equally todo this function not yet completely written inheritdoc see 
SATD	 todo support other kinds tail 
SATD	 todo this the right range here 
SATD	 how handle empty target lists probably the wizstep should only show empty pane that case 
SATD	 this class provides text field that can used display the text all comments associated with annotated modelelement todo this could use more work currently returns all commentname commentbody attributes concatenated together into single readonly document since nov author tom morris tfmorrisgmailcom 
SATD	 todo should assert this never happens before removing panels should control their own listeners 
SATD	 todo implement this 
SATD	 todo this updating model per character basis well event listeners every character very wasteful tfm 
SATD	 todo the project should bound the action when created 
SATD	 todo would better defer this initialization until the panel actually needs displayed perhaps optimistically always return true and figure out later weve got something display tfm 
SATD	 this panel contains radio buttons that represent the changeability asssociationend author since jan todo for uml this needs changed just readonly frozen not changeable 
SATD	 todo what with the return value 
SATD	 todo property name will need updated for uml unfortunately can specify two property names here 
SATD	 todo want fire targetremoved here enough just stop updating the targets 
SATD	 todo expression and instancevalue how anyone have example 
SATD	 not implemented yet 
SATD	 mock the facade the modeleventpump the factories and helpers are all created mock objects using easymock for each them there should also possibility access their link mockcontrol object todo create the rest the getters for the control objects author linus tolke 
SATD	 todo what shall with the exception 
SATD	 todo with new reference resolving scheme the model subsystem will cache the systemid the profile open and resolve the profile its own thus the javautillist will found and the return value will present again 
SATD	 todo suspect this isnt needed call isnt needed but dont remove till out alphabeta stage 
SATD	 the uml model elements test todo this needs updated with version for uml 
SATD	 todo need this this the same emptyfiggetheight 
SATD	 todo use reflection against the test case ensure that does not import nonargouml classes 
SATD	 todo what can with other kind actions 
SATD	 todo maybe return message already exists check first and and the first found has activator then set this call message the activator and skip the code below 
SATD	 todo why need remove then add the fig 
SATD	 todo minimum height should not calculated every time but only when figmessage has been added removed currently doing that doesnt work because unknown problem how test create only two crs and create message between them then move the create message the bottom until that fixed the workaround call updateminimumheight every time the minimum size needed 
SATD	 todo implement 
SATD	 finds the operation which callevent refers based the given transition this function determines the context the statemachine that contains the given transition the context classifier then all operations this classifier are candidates the context behavioralfeature then all operations the owner classifier are candidates the first operation which the name matches the result for activity diagrams the context package then all operations all classifiers the package are candidates todo this function works for the most normal cases but needs some testing for rare cases internal transitions todo the parameters the candidates are ignored maybe this method should return set matching operations author mvw param trans object type transition param opname the name the operation sought return object the operation with the given name null 
SATD	 get the innermost containing model modelelement containing model can found the outermost containing modelelement returned which could the original element itself has owner this method intended return the innermost containing model but there are circumstances where one may really expect the outermost containing model root package returned where its being used test two elements are from disjoint namespace hierarchies hence there are two separate methods with different semantics the method link getrootobject returns the outermost containing object todo note also that some code uses navigate down from the top instead from the bottom need use consistent algorithm for this tfm param handle the model element return model for the model element 
SATD	 theres more handled which still need implemented

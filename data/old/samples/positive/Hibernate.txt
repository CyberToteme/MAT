78: 'necessary register exact since can only appear where clause ',positive
125: 'really there are two situations where should allow the insertion into properties defined superclass unionsubclass with abstract root entity discrimsubclass handled already because the fact that alreay always returns for this call may want disallow for discrimsubclass just for consistencysake currently does not work anyway ',positive
364: 'todo check mimer sql cannot handle the way does ',positive
2: 'todo what else here ',positive
362: 'todo look optimizing these ',positive
353: 'todo unnecessary for databases with ansistyle joins ',positive
356: 'todo include the rowids ',positive
352: 'todo for some dialects would appropriate add the other select strings ',positive
149: 'todo optimize this better ',positive
131: 'would probably refactor have logicparser builds tree simple expressions connected and not expressionparser translates from terms like foo foobar foobarbaz sql terms like foosid foosbarid etc and which does much the same thing does now ',positive
111: 'todo better way ',positive
190: 'todo throw exception ',positive
44: 'todo this very suboptimal for some subclasses namely components since does not take advantage twophaseload ',positive
290: 'todo move into collection type can use polymorphism ',positive

An update to the map and recording of reads may   * not be immediately reflected on the algorithm's data structures. These   * structures are guarded by a lock and operations are applied in batches to   * avoid lock contention. The penalty of applying the batches is spread across   * threads so that the amortized cost is slightly higher than performing just   * the ConcurrentHashMap operation.   *   * A memento of the reads and writes that were performed on the map are   * recorded in buffers. These buffers are drained at the first opportunity   * after a write or when the read buffer exceeds a threshold size. The reads   * are recorded in a lossy buffer, allowing the reordering operations to be   * discarded if the draining process cannot keep up. Due to the concurrent   * nature of the read and write operations a strict policy ordering is not   * possible, but is observably strict when single threaded.   *   * Due to a lack of a strict ordering guarantee, a task can be executed   * out-of-order, such as a removal followed by its addition. The state of the   * entry is encoded within the value's weight.   *   * Alive: The entry is in both the hash-table and the page replacement policy.   * This is represented by a positive weight.   *   * Retired: The entry is not in the hash-table and is pending removal from the   * page replacement policy. This is represented by a negative weight.   *   * Dead: The entry is not in the hash-table and is not in the page replacement   * policy. This is represented by a weight of zero.   *   * The Least Recently Used page replacement algorithm was chosen due to its   * simplicity, high hit rate, and ability to be implemented with O(1) time   * complexity.    */

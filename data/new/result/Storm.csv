1,1,0,1,0,1,1,// This is a bit ugly, but it works.  In order to maintain the same directory structure that existed before   we need to have storm conf, storm jar, and storm code in a shared directory, and we need to set the   permissions for that entire directory, but the tracking is on a per item basis, so we are going to end   up running the permission modification code once for each blob that is downloaded (3 times in this case).   Because the permission modification code runs in a separate process we are doing a global lock to avoid   any races between multiple versions running at the same time.  Ideally this would be on a per topology   basis, but that is a lot harder and the changes run fairly quickly so it should not be a big deal.

The failed records will move from   failedPerShard to emittedPerShard when the failed record is emitted again as a retry.   Logic for deciding what sequence number to commit is find the highest sequence number from ackedPerShard   called X such that there is no sequence   number Y in emittedPerShard or failedPerShard that satisfies X > Y.

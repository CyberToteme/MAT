The swiftc tool chain can build _only_ Swift, so tests that expect to use the swiftc tool chain properly annotate   their requirements with ToolChainRequirement.SWIFTC (or a version-specific requirement).     Our multi-test runner is smart enough to disable tests that do not meet the test's requirements, but since many   of the old tests do not have requirements, we assume the tests require a "C" like tool chain (GCC, Clang, MSVC).

1,0,0,0,0,0,0,//  This piece of ugliness copies the JAXP (ie XML API) provider, if any, from the system ClassLoader. Here's why:     1. When looking for a provider, JAXP looks for a service resource in the context ClassLoader, which is our isolated ClassLoader. If our classpath above does not contain a      provider, this returns null. If it does contain a provider, JAXP extracts the classname from the service resource.   2. If not found, JAXP looks for a service resource in the system ClassLoader. This happens to include all the application classes specified on the classpath. If the application      classpath does not contain a provider, this returns null. If it does contain a provider, JAXP extracts the implementation classname from the service resource.   3. If not found, JAXP uses a default classname   4. JAXP attempts to load the provider using the context ClassLoader. which is our isolated ClassLoader. This is fine if the classname came from step 1 or 3. It blows up if the      classname came from step 2.     So, as a workaround, locate and make visible XML parser classes from the system classloader in our isolated ClassLoader.     Note that in practise, this is only triggered when running in our tests

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,//  This is a workaround for https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/4241   Several early typed operations have `buildPath` property,   the value of which can only be determined after the settings file for the build has loaded.     The workaround is to buffer all operation notifications in memory until the root build's settings have loaded.   This works because all possible settings files have been evaluated by the time the root one has been.   This is not guaranteed to hold into the future.   A proper solution would be to change the operation details/results to be   truly immutable and convey values known at the time.

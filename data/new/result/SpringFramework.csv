A control flow graph contains one node per "basic   block", and one edge per "jump" from one basic block to another. Each node (i.e., each basic   block) is represented with the Label object that corresponds to the first instruction of this   basic block. Each node also stores the list of its successors in the graph, as a linked list of   Edge objects.     The control flow analysis algorithms used to compute the maximum stack size or the stack map   frames are similar and use two steps. The first step, during the visit of each instruction,   builds information about the state of the local variables and the operand stack at the end of   each basic block, called the "output frame", <i>relatively</i> to the frame state at the   beginning of the basic block, which is called the "input frame", and which is <i>unknown</i>   during this step. The second step, in {@link MethodWriter#computeAllFrames} and {@link   MethodWriter#computeMaxStackAndLocal}, is a fix point algorithm   that computes information about the input frame of each basic block, from the input state of   the first basic block (known from the method signature), and by the using the previously   computed relative output frames.     The algorithm used to compute the maximum stack size only computes the relative output and   absolute input stack heights, while the algorithm used to compute stack map frames computes   relative output frames and absolute input frames.

Thanks to the ordering of   frames, having only a "one frame lookahead" is not a problem, i.e. it is not possible to   see an offset smaller than the offset of the current instruction and for which no Label   exist. Except for UNINITIALIZED type offsets. We solve this by parsing the stack map   table without a full decoding (see below).

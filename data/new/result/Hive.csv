In the future, it's OK to add new chars to the escape list, and old data   won't be corrupt, because the full path name in metastore is stored.   In that case, Hive will continue to read the old data, but when it creates   new partitions, it will use new names.   edit : There are some use cases for which adding new chars does not seem   to be backward compatible - Eg. if partition was created with name having   a special char that you want to start escaping, and then you try dropping   the partition with a hive version that now escapes the special char using   the list below, then the drop partition fails to work.

Most PTFs will work in batch mode. *  * The Streaming mode gives up on the capabilities of Partitions for the benefit of smaller footprint, * and faster processing. Window Function processing is an e.g. of this: when there are only Ranking * functions each row needs to be accessed once in the order it is provided; hence there is no need  * to hold all input rows in a Partition. The 'pattern' is: any time you want to only enhance/enrich  * an Input Row Streaming mode is the right choice. This is the fundamental difference between Ranking * fns and UDAFs: Ranking functions keep the original data intact whereas UDAF only return aggregate * information. *  * Finally we have provided a 'mixed' mode where a non Streaming TableFunction can provide its output * as an Iterator. As far as we can tell, this is a special case for Windowing handling. If Windowing * is the only or last TableFunction in a chain, it makes no sense to collect the output rows into a  * output Partition. We justify the pollution of the api by the observation that Windowing is a very  * common use case. *   */

Thus, we need to apply the following logic on the data to extract   the granularity correctly:   1) Read the timestamp with local time-zone value.   2) Extract UTC epoch (millis) from timestamp with local time-zone.   3) Cast the long to a timestamp.   4) Apply the granularity function on the timestamp value.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,//  We called reserveMemory so we know that there's memory waiting for us somewhere.   However, we have a class of rare race conditions related to the order of locking/checking of   different allocation areas. Simple case - say we have 2 arenas, 256Kb available in arena 2.   We look at arena 1; someone deallocs 256Kb from arena 1 and allocs the same from arena 2;   we look at arena 2 and find no memory. Or, for single arena, 2 threads reserve 256k each,   and a single 1Mb block is available. When the 1st thread locks the 1Mb freelist, the 2nd one   might have already examined the 256k and 512k lists, finding nothing. Blocks placed by (1)   into smaller lists after its split is done will not be found by (2); given that freelist   locks don't overlap, (2) may even run completely between the time (1) takes out the 1Mb   block and the time it returns the remaining 768Kb.   Two solutions to this are some form of cross-thread helping (threads putting "demand"   into some sort of queues that deallocate and split will examine), or having and "actor"   allocator thread (or threads per arena).   The 2nd one is probably much simpler and will allow us to get rid of a lot of sync code.

Example:                 UNION_ALL                /         \               /           \              /             \             /               \         MapJoin1          MapJoin2        /   |   \         /   |   \       /    |    \       /    |    \     Big1   S1   S2    Big2   S3   S4   In this case, we have two MapJoins, MapJoin1 and MapJoin2. Big1 and Big2 are two   big tables, and S1, S2, S3, and S4 are four small tables. Hash tables of S1 and S2   will only be used by Map tasks processing Big1. Hash tables of S3 and S4 will only   be used by Map tasks processing Big2. If Big1!=Big2, we should only check if the size   of S1 + S2 is under the limit, and if the size of S3 + S4 is under the limit.   But, right now, we are checking the size of S1 + S2 + S3 + S4 is under the limit.   If Big1=Big2, we will only scan a path once. So, MapJoin1 and MapJoin2 will be executed   in the same Map task. In this case, we need to make sure the size of S1 + S2 + S3 + S4

This   *       list is used in the case of Outer Joins to add null check   *       predicates to the Outer Query's where clause.   *     - Add the SubQuery expression with the alias as a SelectItem to   *       the SubQuery's SelectList.   *     - In case this SubQuery contains aggregation expressions add this SubQuery   *       expression to its GroupBy; add it to the front of the GroupBy.   *   - If predicate is not correlated, let it remain in the SubQuery   *     where clause.   * Additional things for Having clause:   * - A correlation predicate may refer to an aggregation expression.   * - This introduces 2 twists to the rewrite:   *   a. When analyzing equality predicates we need to analyze each side   *      to see if it is an aggregation expression from the Outer Query.   *      So for e.g. this is a valid correlation predicate:   *         R2.x = min(R1.y)   *      Where R1 is an outer table reference, and R2 is a SubQuery table reference.   *   b. When hoisting the correlation predicate to a join predicate, we need to   *      rewrite it to be in the form the Join code allows: so the predict needs   *      to contain a qualified column references.   *      We handle this by generating a new name for the aggregation expression,   *      like R1._gby_sq_col_1 and adding this mapping to the Outer Query's   *      Row Resolver. Then we construct a joining predicate using this new   *      name; so in our e.g. the condition would be: R2.x = R1._gby_sq_col_1    */

Since only local file systems are supported, there is no need to use Hadoop      version of Path class.   2. java.nio package provides modern implementation of file and directory operations      which is better then the traditional java.io, so we are using it here.      In particular, it supports atomic creation of temporary files with specified      permissions in the specified directory. This also avoids various attacks possible      when temp file name is generated first, followed by file creation.      See http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/nio-139333.html for      the description of NIO API and      http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/legacy.html for the      description of interoperability between legacy IO api vs NIO API.   3. To avoid race conditions with readers of the metrics file, the implementation      dumps metrics to a temporary file in the same directory as the actual metrics      file and then renames it to the destination. Since both are located on the same      filesystem, this rename is likely to be atomic (as long as the underlying OS      support atomic renames.     NOTE: This reporter is very similar to         org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.metrics.JsonReporter.         It would be good to unify the two.

His algorithm works on fixed size windows up to the current row. For row   * 'i' and window 'w' it computes the min/max for window (i-w, i). 2. The core   * idea is to keep a queue of (max, idx) tuples. A tuple in the queue   * represents the max value in the range (prev tuple.idx, idx). Using the   * queue data structure and following 2 operations it is easy to see that   * maxes can be computed: - on receiving the ith row; drain the queue from the   * back of any entries whose value is less than the ith entry; add the ith   * value as a tuple in the queue (i-val, i) - on the ith step, check if the   * element at the front of the queue has reached its max range of influence;   * i.e. frontTuple.idx + w > i. If yes we can remove it from the queue. - on   * the ith step o/p the front of the queue as the max for the ith entry.   *   * Here we modify the algorithm: 1. to handle window's that are of the form   * (i-p, i+f), where p is numPreceding,f = numFollowing - we start outputing   * rows only after receiving f rows. - the formula for 'influence range' of an   * idx accounts for the following rows. 2. optimize for the case when   * numPreceding is Unbounded. In this case only 1 max needs to be tarcked at   * any given time.    */

Consider the query:   select * from (select * from V2 union all select * from V3) subq;   where both V2 and V3 depend on V1 (eg V2 : select * from V1, V3: select * from V1),   addInput would be called twice for V1 (one with parent V2 and the other with parent V3).   When addInput is called for the first time for V1, V1 (parent V2) is added to inputs.   When addInput is called for the second time for V1, the input V1 from inputs is picked up,   and it's parents are enhanced to include V2 and V3   The inputs will contain: (V2, no parent), (V3, no parent), (V1, parents(V2, v3))     If the ReadEntity is already present and another ReadEntity with same name is   added, then the isDirect flag is updated to be the OR of values of both.

The db locking system gets confused   by this and dead locks on it.  To resolve that, we'll make sure in the   request that multiple locks are coalesced and promoted to the higher   level of locking.  To do this we put all locks components in trie based   on dbname, tablename, partition name and handle the promotion as new   requests come in.  This structure depends on the fact that null is a   valid key in a LinkedHashMap.  So a database lock will map to (dbname, null,   null).

For each event we process, we tell analyzeTableLoad to   create tasks that use the taskChainTail as a dependency.

This is purely used for matching lexical  rules. The actual token text is stored in the same way as the user input without  actually converting it into an upper case. The token values are generated by the consume()  function of the super class ANTLRStringStream. The LA() function is the lookahead funtion  and is purely used for matching lexical rules. This also means that the grammar will only  accept capitalized tokens in case it is run from other tools like antlrworks which  do not have the ANTLRNoCaseStringStream implementation.

Without jitter, we   wouldn't need this, and could simple look at the first element and sleep for the wait time.   However, when many things are added at once, it may happen that we will see the one that   expires later first, and will sleep past the earlier expiration times. When we wake up we   may kill many sessions at once. To avoid this, we will add to queue under lock and recheck   time before we wait. We don't have to worry about removals; at worst we'd wake up in vain.   Example: expirations of 1:03:00, 1:00:00, 1:02:00 are added (in this order due to jitter).   If the expiration threads sees that 1:03 first, it will sleep for 1:03, then wake up and   kill all 3 sessions at once because they all have expired, removing any effect from jitter.   Instead, expiration thread rechecks the first queue item and waits on the queue. If nothing   is added to the queue, the item examined is still the earliest to be expired. If someone   adds to the queue while it is waiting, it will notify the thread and it would wake up and   recheck the queue.

At best, we'd end up   with spurious disk reads if we cache on row boundaries but splits include torn rows.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,//    Implementation notes.     1. Since only local file systems are supported, there is no need to use Hadoop      version of Path class.   2. java.nio package provides modern implementation of file and directory operations      which is better then the traditional java.io, so we are using it here.      In particular, it supports atomic creation of temporary files with specified      permissions in the specified directory. This also avoids various attacks possible      when temp file name is generated first, followed by file creation.      See http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/nio-139333.html for      the description of NIO API and      http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/legacy.html for the      description of interoperability between legacy IO api vs NIO API.   3. To avoid race conditions with readers of the metrics file, the implementation      dumps metrics to a temporary file in the same directory as the actual metrics      file and then renames it to the destination. Since both are located on the same      filesystem, this rename is likely to be atomic (as long as the underlying OS      support atomic renames.     NOTE: This reporter is very similar to         org.apache.hadoop.hive.common.metrics.metrics2.JsonFileMetricsReporter.         org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.metrics.JsonReporter.

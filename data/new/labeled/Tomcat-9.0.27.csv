0, JavaDoc, /*  *  CGI-invoking servlet for web applications, used to execute scripts which *  comply to the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) specification and are named *  in the path-info used to invoke this servlet. * * <p> * <i>Note: This code compiles and even works for simple CGI cases. *          Exhaustive testing has not been done.  Please consider it beta *          quality.  Feedback is appreciated to the author (see below).</i> * </p> * <p> * * <b>Example</b>:<br> * If an instance of this servlet was mapped (using *       <code>&lt;web-app&gt;/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>) to: * </p> * <p> * <code> * &lt;web-app&gt;/cgi-bin/* * </code> * </p> * <p> * then the following request: * </p> * <p> * <code> * http://localhost:8080/&lt;web-app&gt;/cgi-bin/dir1/script/pathinfo1 * </code> * </p> * <p> * would result in the execution of the script * </p> * <p> * <code> * &lt;web-app-root&gt;/WEB-INF/cgi/dir1/script * </code> * </p> * <p> * with the script's <code>PATH_INFO</code> set to <code>/pathinfo1</code>. * </p> * <p> * Recommendation:  House all your CGI scripts under * <code>&lt;webapp&gt;/WEB-INF/cgi</code>.  This will ensure that you do not * accidentally expose your cgi scripts' code to the outside world and that * your cgis will be cleanly ensconced underneath the WEB-INF (i.e., * non-content) area. * </p> * <p> * The default CGI location is mentioned above.  You have the flexibility to * put CGIs wherever you want, however: * </p> * <p> *   The CGI search path will start at *   webAppRootDir + File.separator + cgiPathPrefix *   (or webAppRootDir alone if cgiPathPrefix is *   null). * </p> * <p> *   cgiPathPrefix is defined by setting *   this servlet's cgiPathPrefix init parameter * </p> * * <p> * * <B>CGI Specification</B>:<br> derived from * <a href="http://cgi-spec.golux.com">http://cgi-spec.golux.com</a>. * A work-in-progress &amp; expired Internet Draft.  Note no actual RFC describing * the CGI specification exists.  Where the behavior of this servlet differs * from the specification cited above, it is either documented here, a bug, * or an instance where the specification cited differs from Best * Community Practice (BCP). * Such instances should be well-documented here.  Please email the * <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/lists.html">Tomcat group</a> * with amendments. * * </p> * <p> * * <b>Canonical metavariables</b>:<br> * The CGI specification defines the following canonical metavariables: * <br> * [excerpt from CGI specification] * <PRE> *  AUTH_TYPE *  CONTENT_LENGTH *  CONTENT_TYPE *  GATEWAY_INTERFACE *  PATH_INFO *  PATH_TRANSLATED *  QUERY_STRING *  REMOTE_ADDR *  REMOTE_HOST *  REMOTE_IDENT *  REMOTE_USER *  REQUEST_METHOD *  SCRIPT_NAME *  SERVER_NAME *  SERVER_PORT *  SERVER_PROTOCOL *  SERVER_SOFTWARE * </PRE> * <p> * Metavariables with names beginning with the protocol name (<EM>e.g.</EM>, * "HTTP_ACCEPT") are also canonical in their description of request header * fields.  The number and meaning of these fields may change independently * of this specification.  (See also section 6.1.5 [of the CGI specification].) * </p> * [end excerpt] * * <h2> Implementation notes</h2> * <p> * * <b>standard input handling</b>: If your script accepts standard input, * then the client must start sending input within a certain timeout period, * otherwise the servlet will assume no input is coming and carry on running * the script.  The script's the standard input will be closed and handling of * any further input from the client is undefined.  Most likely it will be * ignored.  If this behavior becomes undesirable, then this servlet needs * to be enhanced to handle threading of the spawned process' stdin, stdout, * and stderr (which should not be too hard). * <br> * If you find your cgi scripts are timing out receiving input, you can set * the init parameter <code>stderrTimeout</code> of your webapps' cgi-handling * servlet. * </p> * <p> * * <b>Metavariable Values</b>: According to the CGI specification, * implementations may choose to represent both null or missing values in an * implementation-specific manner, but must define that manner.  This * implementation chooses to always define all required metavariables, but * set the value to "" for all metavariables whose value is either null or * undefined.  PATH_TRANSLATED is the sole exception to this rule, as per the * CGI Specification. * * </p> * <p> * * <b>NPH --  Non-parsed-header implementation</b>:  This implementation does * not support the CGI NPH concept, whereby server ensures that the data * supplied to the script are precisely as supplied by the client and * unaltered by the server. * </p> * <p> * The function of a servlet container (including Tomcat) is specifically * designed to parse and possible alter CGI-specific variables, and as * such makes NPH functionality difficult to support. * </p> * <p> * The CGI specification states that compliant servers MAY support NPH output. * It does not state servers MUST support NPH output to be unconditionally * compliant.  Thus, this implementation maintains unconditional compliance * with the specification though NPH support is not present. * </p> * <p> * * The CGI specification is located at * <a href="http://cgi-spec.golux.com">http://cgi-spec.golux.com</a>. * * </p> * <h3>TODO:</h3> * <ul> * <li> Support for setting headers (for example, Location headers don't work) * <li> Support for collapsing multiple header lines (per RFC 2616) * <li> Ensure handling of POST method does not interfere with 2.3 Filters * <li> Refactor some debug code out of core * <li> Ensure header handling preserves encoding * <li> Possibly rewrite CGIRunner.run()? * <li> Possibly refactor CGIRunner and CGIEnvironment as non-inner classes? * <li> Document handling of cgi stdin when there is no stdin * <li> Revisit IOException handling in CGIRunner.run() * <li> Better documentation * <li> Confirm use of ServletInputStream.available() in CGIRunner.run() is *      not needed * <li> [add more to this TODO list] * </ul> * * @author Martin T Dengler [root@martindengler.com] * @author Amy Roh  */

If set to true, the log file's existence will be checked before * each logging. This way an external log rotator can move the file * somewhere and Tomcat will start with a new file. * </p> * * <p> * For JMX junkies, a public method called <code>rotate</code> has * been made available to allow you to tell this instance to move * the existing log file to somewhere else and start writing a new log file. * </p> * * <p> * Conditional logging is also supported. This can be done with the * <code>condition</code> property. * If the value returned from ServletRequest.getAttribute(condition) * yields a non-null value, the logging will be skipped. * </p> * * <p> * For extended attributes coming from a getAttribute() call, * it is you responsibility to ensure there are no newline or * control characters. * </p> * * @author Peter Rossbach  */

To test allocation, the connection window size is increased by 1.   This should result in an allocation of 1 byte each to streams 19 and   21 but because each stream is processed in a separate thread it is   not guaranteed that both streams will be blocked when the connection   window size is increased. The test therefore sends 1 byte window   updates until a small body has been seen from each stream. Then the   tests sends a larger (1024 byte) window update and checks that it is   correctly distributed between the streams.     The test includes a margin to allow for the potential differences in   response caused by timing differences on the server.     The loop below handles 0, 1 or 2 stream being blocked   - If 0 streams are blocked the connection window will be set to one     and that will be consumed by the first stream to attempt to write.     That body frame will be read by the client. The stream will then be     blocked and the loop will start again.   - If 1 stream is blocked, the connection window will be set to one     which will then be consumed by the blocked stream. After writing     the single byte the stream will again be blocked and the loop will     start again.   - If 2 streams are blocked the connection window will be set to one     but one byte will be permitted for both streams (due to rounding in     the allocation). The window size should be -1 (see below). Two     frames (one for each stream will be written) one of which will be     consumed by the client. The loop will start again and the Window     size incremented to zero. No data will be written by the streams     but the second data frame written in the last iteration of the loop     will be read.

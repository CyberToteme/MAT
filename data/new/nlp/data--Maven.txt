SATD	 todo extensions like flex mojos use custom scopes like merged internal external etc order dont break backwardcompat with those only warn but dont error out 
SATD	 todo this needs accept link returned link but its not used like that 
SATD	 its the building the grandchild project having already cached the child project but not the parent project which causes the problem 
SATD	 todo would like get rid this jvz 
SATD	 note this should considered quirk support interop with mavens legacy artifactdeployer which processes one artifact time and hence cannot associate the artifacts from the same project use the same timestampbuildno for the snapshot versions allowing the caller pass metadata from previous deployment allows reestablish the association between the artifacts the same project 
SATD	 todo really wondering where this method belongs smells like should mavenproject but for some reason isnt this localization kindof code smell 
SATD	 todo hack because metadata isnt generated correctly and want run the maven have the 
SATD	 todo this does not belong here 
SATD	 this foul 
SATD	 note theres and 
SATD	 derive the path portion the given url param url the repository url return the basedir the repository todo need url decode for spaces 
SATD	 todo restore these makes sense 
SATD	 todo could the configuration passed lookup and the configurator known plexus via the descriptor that this method could entirely handled plexus lookup 
SATD	 todo error reporting 
SATD	 todo this replacing shouldnt necessary userhome should the 
SATD	 todo currently this first wins but really should take the latest comparing either the snapshot timestamp some other timestamp later encoded into the metadata todo this needs repeated here the merging doesnt interfere with the written metadata wed much better having pristine input and ongoing metadata for merging instead 
SATD	 todo what about wildcards just specifying groups versions 
SATD	 todo use stringutils here 
SATD	 todo from concurrency perspective this class not good the combination mutableimmutable state not nice 
SATD	 todo probably want warn the user that building artifact with different values than 
SATD	 not sure this last regexp was really intended disallow the usage network paths userhome directory unfortunately did removed and have not detected any problems yet path pathreplaceall 
SATD	 todo better way than static this might hide messages reactor 
SATD	 this exception thrown application attempts attach two the same artifacts single project author pgier author jdcasey todo make this checked exception and modify the api mavenprojecthelper currently this modification would create compatibility problems for existing plugins 
SATD	 todo lifecycles being executed todo what runs each phase todo plugins that need downloading todo project dependencies that need downloading todo unfortunately the plugins need downloaded order get the pluginxml file need externalize this from the plugin archive todo this will the class that people get ides modify 
SATD	 note for plugins that depend other plugin artifacts the plugin realm contains more than one plugin descriptor however only the first descriptor interest 
SATD	 todo not sure about this here and may want getlog here wellinstead 
SATD	 todo does this check need happen here had add the same call below when iterate child nodes will that suffice 
SATD	 todo mng changes likely made this redundant 
SATD	 todo move this plexusutils pathtool 
SATD	 find the version this total hack see previous comment 
SATD	 note this primarily keep backwardcompat with maven which did not validate that dependencies are unique within single pom upon multiple declarations just kept the last one but retained the order the first occurrence when were lenientcompat mode have deal with such broken poms and mimic the way works when were strict mode the removal duplicates just saves other merging steps from aftereffects and bogus error messages 
SATD	 todo validate for 
SATD	 mng neither have reserved all the above magic expressions nor their set fixedwellknown gets occasionally extended newer maven versions this imposes the risk for existing plugins unintentionally use such magic expression for ordinary system property here check whether ended with magic value that not compatible with the type the configured mojo parameter string could still converted the configurator leave those alone back off evaluating the expression from properties only 
SATD	 this not ideal but there are events specifically for configuration from the cli which dont believe are really valid but there are its which assert the right events are published this needs supported the eventspydispatcher needs put the clirequest that can accessed configuration processors 
SATD	 todo could use map maybe the parent did that for components too this too vulnerable 
SATD	 todo current policy retain the original version this correct need strategies that handled elsewhere 
SATD	 todo the configuration for the lifecycle needs externalized that can use the annotations properly for the wiring and reference and external source for the lifecycle configuration 
SATD	 todo similar test should created test the dependency management basically all usages are affected mng 
SATD	 todo shouldnt the versions merged across relocations 
SATD	 todo this should not need handed off 
SATD	 note this will not hit for maven projectxml incompatible schema 
SATD	 todo push all common bits back plexus cli and prepare for transition guice dont need ways make clis 
SATD	 metadata resolution exceptions 
SATD	 todo why this using the context 
SATD	 todo jul check this were using and there are aggregator tasks this will result weirdness 
SATD	 validate versions arent inherited when using parent ranges the same way when read externally 
SATD	 todo need externalize clirequest 
SATD	 should get whole slew dependencies resolving this artifact transitively 
SATD	 note should not inheriting status since this assessment the pom quality note should not inheriting relocation since this relates single pom 
SATD	 todo could more efficient sorting the list and then moving along the restrictions order 
SATD	 set the recommended version todo maybe its better just pass the range through retrieval and use transformation 
SATD	 there are too many dont know which one run report the error 
SATD	 any 
SATD	 exception that occurs when artifact file used but has not been resolved author portera todo may better for artifactgetfile throw perhaps runtime exception 
SATD	 todo log message throw exception 
SATD	 note this exists merely for backwardcompat with legacystyle lifecycle definitions and allows configuration injection work instead failing 
SATD	 this class needs stick around because was exposed the the remote resources plugin started using instead getting the repositories from the project 
SATD	 maven quirk artifact always points the local repo regardless whether resolved not 
SATD	 todo optimize maybe just rewrite the whole way aggregating mojos are being run 
SATD	 note getid was added and such not implemented plugins compiled against apis 
SATD	 todo dont catch exception 
SATD	 todo use settings 
SATD	 todo whether duplicates should removed looks like option for the generated merger 
SATD	 todo these two tests display lack symmetry with respect the input which free form string and the mojo descriptor which comes back all the free form parsing needs done somewhere else this really the function the cli and then the preprocessing that output still needs fed into hinting process which helps flesh out the full specification the plugin the plugin manager should only deal concrete terms all version finding mumbo jumbo customization base functionality the plugin manager provides 
SATD	 todo this will the basis the customizable lifecycle execution need figure this out quickly 
SATD	 todo use the following two instead manageartifact todo remove interface 
SATD	 have collected all the problems lets mimic the way the old code worked and just blow right here thats right lets just let rip right here and send big incomprehensible blob text unsuspecting users bad dog 
SATD	 note see mng this causes problem but fixing may break more 
SATD	 fixme this hacky what module directory doesnt match artifactid and parent coming from the repository 
SATD	 note currently unchecked careful removing this trycatch this necessary avoid creating compatibility problems for existing plugins that use 
SATD	 describes version transformation during artifact resolution author portera todo try and refactor remove abstract mainmethods not particular happy about current design 
SATD	 return the required dependencies specified scope todo the name not intelligible 
SATD	 todo shouldnt need double this work only done for simplicity handling recommended 
SATD	 trying give loggers back bad idea ceki said notice self what was this method supposed 
SATD	 todo kristian wonders this class really necessary and overlaps other concepts 
SATD	 todo might better have sourceretrieve throw specific exception for this situation 
SATD	 this really wagon something went wrong after successfully retrieved the metadata 
SATD	 filter exclude from list artifact patterns author portera todo think this equiv exclusion set filter mavencore 
SATD	 todo this only provide project for plugins that dont need project execute but need some the values from mavenproject ideally this should something internal and nothing outside maven 
SATD	 todo why mvn adds dot paths 
SATD	 todo introducing space herenot sure what else but collapse whitespace 
SATD	 igorf way too many declared exceptions 
SATD	 describes repository directory metadata author portera todo not happy about the store method they use this 
SATD	 todo currently cannot tell which section contained the management information when the resolver provides this information these log messages should updated contain 
SATD	 todo hack make the cycle detection the same for the new graph builder 
SATD	 todo the antrun plugin has its own configurator the only plugin that does might need think about how that works todo remove the 
SATD	 todo jvz why isnt all this checking the job the duty the workspace resolver know that have model that suitable yet more checks are done here and the one for the version problematic before because with parents ranges will never work this scenario 
SATD	 todo the order the merged list could controlled attribute the model association targetfirst sourcefirst dominantfirst recessivefirst 
SATD	 todo add better exception 
SATD	 todo let the scope handler deal with this 
SATD	 artifact not things like the stupid dummy artifact coming from surefire 
SATD	 this just silly lookuplist should return empty list 
SATD	 todo this needs colorized 
SATD	 todo whether the merge continues recursively into existing node not could option for the generated merger 
SATD	 specific problems during resolution that want account for limissing metadatali liversion range violationsli liversion circular dependenciesli limissing artifactsli linetworktransfer errorsli lifile system errors permissionsli author jason van zyl todo carlos all these possible hasexceptions and getexceptions mainmethods make the clients too complex requiring long list checks need create for the types exceptions 
SATD	 todo this needs accept link returned link but its not used like that link 
SATD	 mavenapi fixme the dag used not only used represent the dependency relation but also for parent buildplugin reports need multiple dags since dag can only handle type relationship properly usecase this detected cycle parent orgapachemavenmaven inherited reporting dependency this case both the verify and the report goals are called different lifecycle though the compilerplugin has valid usecase although that seems work fine need take versions and lifecycle into account 
SATD	 dont want the artifacts version here this stored the directory above that 
SATD	 use regular expression search find and resolve expressions within the pom author jdcasey created feb todo consolidate this logic with the minus deprecationsbans 
SATD	 fixme filter out the inherited false stuff 
SATD	 todo plugindescriptor classrealm and artifacts are set side effect this call which not nice throws 
SATD	 need set the file here the resolver will fail with npe not fully equipped deal with multiple local repository implementations yet 
SATD	 todo was null really need find them now this taken care the ordering 
SATD	 this wont valid but constructs something easy read the error message 
SATD	 todo this should eventually migrated 
SATD	 note other configurators like the maporiented one dont call into the listener the hard way 
SATD	 wraps active project instance able receive updates from its artifact without affecting the original attributes this artifact author portera todo think this exposes design flaw that the immutable and mutable parts artifact are one class and should split scope file etc depend the context use whereas everything else immutable 
SATD	 some better conventions for the test poms needs created and each these tests that represent verification specification item needs couple lines most the expressions help lot but need clean pick directory poms automatically load them into resolver create the expression extract the data validate the model and the uri validate the properties also need way navigate from the tex specification documents 
SATD	 todo classpath check doesnt belong here thats the other method 
SATD	 todo not entirely the same message 
SATD	 todo this could lot nicer should really the snapshot transformation 
SATD	 todo should this part mediation 
SATD	 fixme somehow report the user that there are too many elements for now ignore the extra 
SATD	 mng hack workaround deficiency legacy api which makes impossible for plugins access the global profile manager which required build pom like cli invocation does failure consider the activated profiles can cause repo declarations lost which turn will result artifact resolution failures particular when using the enhanced local repo which guards access local files based the configured remote repos 
SATD	 todo without this could just evaluate call 
SATD	 builder concurrency and parallelism preserve the existing mainmethods for builder selection which look for various inputs the threading configuration dont have easy way allow pluggable builder provide its own configuration parameters but this sufficient for now ultimately want components like builders provide way extend the command line accept its own configuration parameters 
SATD	 todo ick this forces the oce that should have come from the previous call still 
SATD	 maybe its better move some those mainmethods separate class soc 
SATD	 todo not sure how best set these for this implementation 
SATD	 note this should considered quirk support interop with mavens legacy artifactdeployer which processes one artifact time and hence cannot associate the artifacts from the same project use the same version index allowing the caller pass metadata from previous deployment allows reestablish the association between the artifacts the same project 
SATD	 todo shouldnt need file intermediatary improve wagon take stream 
SATD	 todo should deprecate 
SATD	 shouldnt javasources given the classifier shouldnt false given the classifier 
SATD	 validation error continue project building and delay failing help ides 
SATD	 the bean containing the mojo descriptorbr for more information about the usage tag have look todo there need for the delegation mavenmojodescriptor this why not just extend componentdescriptor here 
SATD	 todo add better exception that can detail the two conflicting artifacts 
SATD	 todo remove this 
SATD	 todo also this logging for other metadata 
SATD	 note from empty string and null both denote classifier however some plugins only check for null sure nullify empty classifier 
SATD	 todo not sure that should assume this maybe the calls addmetadata should premerge then artifact replaces 
SATD	 why are just ignoring this exception are exceptions are being used for flow control 
SATD	 todo this too early for build extensions maybe just remove 
SATD	 the workspacereactor flux better not assume definitive information for any its artifactsprojects 
SATD	 blech this isnt even intelligible method name provided for consistency 
SATD	 pseudo test generate documentation fragment about supported cli options todo such documentation generation code should not necessary unit test but should run during site generation velocity doxia macro 
SATD	 todo throw something instead

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 expected 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this child node managed dependency ensure are using the dependency management version this child applicable want use the managed versions pom not any other versions pom 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 here need determine which policy use release updateinterval will used when the metadata refers release artifact metaversion and snapshot updateinterval will used when refers snapshot artifact metaversion note release metadata includes version information about artifacts that have been released allow metaversions like release and latest resolve and also allow retrieval the range valid released artifacts available 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 verify few typical parameters are not duplicated

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the parent version may have resolved something different take what asked for instead childsetversion parentgetversion 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 are going take the project packaging and find all plugins the default lifecycle and create fully populated plugin objects including executions with goals and default configuration taken from the pluginxml inside plugin 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 noinspection 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 now have url the form filepath 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 execute 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 test build where projects use different versions the same plugin 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 mkleint does this need public

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 resources 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 url 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 used invoker plugin

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 mng 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when model read from repo stream used then pomfile null has consequences inheritance algorithm since getprojectdirectory returns null 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need get the latest file for the project not the artifact that was created one point time 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 mng 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make copy the original the pom doesnt get messed with 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 fix for mng assembly cache was not being populated for later reference

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 attributes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 extensions 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 artifact transfer mechanism 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note users occasionally misuse the local for remote repos which screws the metadata the local repository this especially troublesome during snapshot resolution try handle that gracefully 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this has separate statement capture the case dfoobar 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 catch means the transferread succeeded but the checksum doesnt match this could problem with the server ibiblio http error page well try this two times the second try well handle bonafide error based the repositorys checksum checking policy 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 older wagons throw this just get instead 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 same instance from version cache 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo turn equivalent back when the plugin released 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 systempath 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 file could not found was not valid start from scratch 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note intentionally only support basedir and not projectbasedir the latter form would suggest that other project expressions can used which however beyond the design 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 ordinary relative path align with base dir 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 build the regular repos after extensions are loaded allow for custom layouts 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 email 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 protected mainmethods 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 final 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 just make sure all the bases are covered 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 conflictresolver mainmethods 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 simple checks first short circuit processing below 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo this checking for file null happens because the resolver has been confused about the root 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for given project packaging find all the plugins that are bound any registered lifecycles the project builder needs now what default plugin information needs merged into pom being built once the pom builder has this plugin information versions can assigned the pom builder because they will have defined plugin management once this setcomplete then can passed back that the default configuration information can populated need know the specific version that can lookup the right version the plugin descriptor which tells what the default configuration 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nonjavadoc see 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 determine the lifecycle that corresponds the given phase 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 probably not worth but here make sure restore request its original state 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 default does nothing 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 length chars 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the pom has file cached missing artifact only return the cached data update forced 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 local wins now and irrelevant not local testprovided arent transitive assertequals check artifactscope 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 mng 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 before update the version the artifact need know whether are working transitive dependency not this allows depmgmt always override transitive dependencies while explicit child override depmgmt viz depmgmt should only provide defaults children but should override transitives can this calling ischildofrootnode the current node 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 leave optional ones but dont pick its dependencies 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 mng 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo used the enforcer plugin 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 orgeclipseemfv 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 filters 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 just hide the one method want behind the repositorysystem interface 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 mng 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the temporary file named destination tmp and done this way ensure that the temporary file the same file system the destination because the filerenameto operation doesnt really work across file systems will attempt filerenameto for efficiency and atomicity this fails then will use brute force copy and delete the temporary file 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 snapshot artifact repository 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont allow construction 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 artifact repository policies 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 bad url just skip here should have been validated already but the wagon lookup will deal with 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 customizations available via the cli 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 map types artifacts 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 create and cache extensions realms 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make copy get rid needless overhead for dynamic lookups 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 now that have everything that need will fire plexus and bring the maven component life for use

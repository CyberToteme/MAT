SATD	 important for async scenario must remove context from current thread always create new rpccontext for the next invoke for the same thread 
SATD	 todo move somewhere else better 
SATD	 fixme now need check first then load 
SATD	 todo contextsessions the best option here jetty becomes 
SATD	 todo move names constants 
SATD	 ignore concurrent problem 
SATD	 todo add this provider config 
SATD	 special treatment array values was suggested lizongbo 
SATD	 todo should leave this setting slfj 
SATD	 fixme when the thread pool full cannot return properly therefore the consumer side has wait until gets timeout this temporary solution prevent this scenario from happening but better solution should considered later 
SATD	 the initial value null and the midway may assigned null please use the local variable reference 
SATD	 fixme requestcontext 
SATD	 possible here 
SATD	 for example object transported the wire doesnt implement serializable 
SATD	 bug dubbo 
SATD	 fixme log error message codec and handle caught iohanndler 
SATD	 there may some problem handling chinese negative number recognition ignoring this problem the backspace key only meaningfully input real telnet program 
SATD	 this unstable consider remove later see 
SATD	 bug dubbo 
SATD	 todo more sophisticated exception handling and output 
SATD	 todo for now kryo serialization doesnt deny classes that dont implement the serializable interface pre ltdubboprotocol serializationkryo pre 
SATD	 delimstart was escaped thus should not incremented 
SATD	 todo users can override this mapper but just rely the current priority strategy resteasy 
SATD	 fixme waiting for embedded nacos suport then can open the switch 
SATD	 todo generic invoker 
SATD	 fixme this instance will always type configcenterconfig will load the instance startup and assign here 
SATD	 todo not want use spaces see dubbo url class handles special conventions for special characters 
SATD	 should destroy resource 
SATD	 hack use reflection get the shared channel 
SATD	 todo notification failure does not restore mechanism guarantee 
SATD	 todo fix npe 
SATD	 todo needs use force writing file that buffer gets clear and new log can written 
SATD	 reselect before retry avoid change candidate invokers note invokers changed then invoked also lose accuracy 
SATD	 todo load spi will better 
SATD	 fixme reject exception can not sent consumer because thread pool full resulting consumers waiting till timeout 
SATD	 todo refactor using mockito 
SATD	 generally client can only closed once here closed twice counter incorrect 
SATD	 todo temporary solution the problem that the exception information can not sent the opposite end after the thread pool full need refactoring fix the thread pool full refuses call does not return and causes the consumer wait for time out 
SATD	 todo the future maybe can just use single rest client and connection manager 
SATD	 caution 
SATD	 todo solve merge problem 
SATD	 fixme hack make work 
SATD	 the buffer big enough 
SATD	 bug dubbo version config retryfalse providers method doesnt work 
SATD	 fixme this exposes the design flaw routerchain 
SATD	 fixme responsecontext 
SATD	 todo jetty will default enable keepalive the xml config has effect now 
SATD	 cannot write not available 
SATD	 todo wrapper cannot handle this scenario correctly the classname contains 
SATD	 server side thrift can not handle exceptions not declared idl 
SATD	 todo assert error log 
SATD	 this class represents unfinished rpc call will hold some context information for this call for example rpccontext and invocation that when the call finishes and the result returns can guarantee all the contexts being recovered the same when the call was made before any callback invoked todo its reasonable even right keep reference invocation link result implements completionstage link asyncrpcresult allows you easily build async filter chain whose status will driven entirely the state the underlying rpc call asyncrpcresult does not contain any concrete value except the underlying value bring completablefuture consider status transfer node link getvalue and link getexception are all inherited from link result interface implementing them are mainly for compatibility consideration because many legacy link filter implementation are most possibly call getvalue directly 
SATD	 fixme should put exception future 
SATD	 dubbo methods key providers urlone doesnt contain the methods from inherited super interface 
SATD	 todo need enhance assertion 
SATD	 fixme this code looks useless 
SATD	 todo due dubbos current architecture will called from registry protocol the shutdown process and wont appear logs 
SATD	 todo can load successfully for different classloader 
SATD	 the status input has problem and the read information wrong when the serialization serialized 
SATD	 fixme not sure why has both isgeneric and getgeneric 
SATD	 fixme result asyncrpcresult instance 
SATD	 fixme should cancel and restart timer tasks parameters the new url are different 
SATD	 todo extract more code here necessary 
SATD	 fixme rmi protocol doesnt support casting echoservice yet 
SATD	 dubbos original impl cant support the use servletcontext 
SATD	 deprecated subscribe override rules before 
SATD	 subscribe the override data fixme when the provider subscribes will affect the scene certain jvm exposes the service and call the same service because the subscribed cached key with the name the service causes the 
SATD	 should called after config was fully initialized fixme this method should completely replaced appendparameters return see object string notice this method should include all properties the returning map treat parameter differently compared appendparameters 
SATD	 todo can the value returned getchannel null need improvement 
SATD	 todo support wildcards 
SATD	 fixme cannot guarantee the sequence the merge result check implementation 
SATD	 fixme there any need failing back constantsanyvalue the first available method invokers when invokers null 
SATD	 todo more configs add 
SATD	 bug dubbo provider doesnt have exception output and consumer has timeout error when serialization fails 
SATD	 fixme theres place release connectionexecutor 
SATD	 todo refactor 
SATD	 every invoker has the same weight 
SATD	 todo this may not pretty elegant solution 
SATD	 fixme log error info codec and put all error handle logic iohanndler 
SATD	 cant shutdown nioeventloopgroup because the method will invoked when closing one channel but not client but when and how close the nioeventloopgroup 
SATD	 fixme this really necessary should have already covered this see see 
SATD	 the resident routers must being initialized before address notification fixme this method should not public 
SATD	 todo there may have duplicate refresh 
SATD	 fixme replace this with better method 
SATD	 todo for now dont consider the differences encoding and server limit 
SATD	 fixme check and any conditions that need match 
SATD	 rmi needs extra parameter since uses customized remote invocation object the customized remoteinvocation was firstly introduced the package was renamed orgapache since considering the above two conditions need check before sending customized remoteinvocation the provider version higher send the provider version higher send the provider version lower than does not use customized remoteinvocation 
SATD	 todo exist concurrent gap 
SATD	 todo fixme the thread pool should used refresh the address otherwise the task may accumulated 
SATD	 theres dynamic tag rule being set use static tag url typical scenario consumer using version calls providers using version lower the consumer should always respect the tag provider url regardless whether dynamic tag rule has been set not todo guarantee consistent behavior interoperability between and this method should has the same logic with the tagrouter param invokers param url param invocation param return

SATD	 metainfo about java component todo this some legacy stuff merged into other component interfaces 
SATD	 todo need track symbol extraction tool 
SATD	 todo this should modeled differently perhaps dependency the implementation configuration 
SATD	 this not super nice but dependencies are created through reflection for decoration and assume constructor with arguments group name version which suitable for most cases could create empty attribute set directly the but then wouldnt mutable therefore proceed with late injection the attributes 
SATD	 todo should split this that the inputs are attached object that represents the binary which then later used configure the linkassemble tasks 
SATD	 need wrap this into loop because theres always risk that the method which weakly referenced has been collected between the creation time and now 
SATD	 tododaniel should support better way multi file invocation 
SATD	 its true right now that this always coming from the testkit but might not the future 
SATD	 todo dont select again here the selection already performed select the toolchain 
SATD	 todo include link documentation giving more explanation whats going here 
SATD	 todo migrate this away from here 
SATD	 this looks ugly very ugly but that apparently what ant does itself 
SATD	 todo should incremental 
SATD	 todo this terrible 
SATD	 todo this should actually routable message with single handler but need some way correlate given request with specific response channel 
SATD	 todo this pretty nasty look avoiding using time bomb stub here 
SATD	 todorbo change the parameter type transformerstring nullable string once migrate java 
SATD	 todo make this work windows originalinclose 
SATD	 todo better exception type 
SATD	 note this would better housed scope that encapsulated the tree gradle objects 
SATD	 sane enough 
SATD	 link that can used task input property caches the matching set files during task execution and discards the result after task execution todo disallow further changes this collection once task has started todo keep the file entries snapshot later avoid stat each file during snapshot 
SATD	 todo this class and executionplan have many the same behavior and concerns should look for way generalize this pattern 
SATD	 remove this 
SATD	 can only set once should really part the constructor can only set once should really part the constructor 
SATD	 this isnt quite right may lose precision when converting double 
SATD	 decimalformat not thread safe synchronize access the instance 
SATD	 todo wire this stuff properly 
SATD	 todoadam need cleanup completion too not used 
SATD	 todo need check for proper typecast 
SATD	 todo should use resolver that this method consistent with projecturistring 
SATD	 todo wolfs schedule fingerprinting separately can done without having the project lock 
SATD	 note dont actually remove this the deprecation here encourage people use objectfactory instead just remove the overload and the nag and leave the method here 
SATD	 todo consider issues teamcity has the concept wave messages where each threadprocess uses unique wave 
SATD	 todo reduce duplication with swift binary 
SATD	 todo move bootclasspath platform 
SATD	 todo this should modeled source set 
SATD	 todo the project model should reachable from projectstate without another lookup 
SATD	 todo locate this tool from tool provider hide main symbol 
SATD	 todo this prefix shouldnt hardcoded 
SATD	 todolptr remove projection for reference node this shouldnt needed but theres actual value referenced model report can only show the type the node this for now should use the schema instead find the type the property node instead 
SATD	 todoadam switch the logging back need make sending messages from daemon client async wrt log event generation loggerdebugignoring failure extract throwable stack trace ignored 
SATD	 todo need failure handling cannot clone repository 
SATD	 todo this should actually compare sortedset 
SATD	 todo validate that its valid model path 
SATD	 the visual tools use the path find other executables todoadam restrict this the specific path for the target tool 
SATD	 todopm move this warn level once fixed mavenpublish see gradlegradle 
SATD	 todoadam this isnt quite right think refers the first capable classloader loading the class this could different from the loader which originally loaded which could pose equality and lifecycle issues 
SATD	 todocedric this approximation when component wants compile against the assembly library not the jar then should give the stubbed classes instead the raw classes however theres such thing stubbed classes assembly for performance reasons only the classes that belong the api are stubbed would miss the classes that not belong the api this makes the usagekindapi misleading should this compile 
SATD	 immutable view the variant component todo this should replace merge into outgoingvariant 
SATD	 because its capability conflict resolution there only one candidate per module identifier can lenient wrt the version number used the descriptor which helps whenever the user used the convenience notation method 
SATD	 todo improve lookup reusing availablejavahomes testfixture for now play safe and just return false 
SATD	 todo should decorate 
SATD	 todo removing this stuff from the store should handled through some sort decoration 
SATD	 todo fix the way work out which exception important not always the most helpful 
SATD	 todo need any factories here 
SATD	 todohh this should moved back into languagenative project 
SATD	 todo make this work with pending elements 
SATD	 todo ultimately this should some kind party dependency thats visible dependency management 
SATD	 todo these should come from somewhere else probably 
SATD	 todo this should become smarter and move into the compiler infrastructure instead the task similar how the other native languages are done for now this does rudimentary incremental build analysis looking which files changed 
SATD	 minimal resolver which does not use any native services used during bootstrap only you should generally use link fileresolver instead todo share more stuff with 
SATD	 list instance needed here does not support serializing iterators directly 
SATD	 todolptr this should added only the scan plugin applied but todolptr expects added also when the build cache enabled but not the scan plugin 
SATD	 todo should set this for macos but this currently breaks xctest support for swift when swift depends libraries built gradle 
SATD	 todolptr when drop java support can switch using classloadergetname instead storing our own 
SATD	 todo provide abstraction for accessing resources within the same module mavenmetadata directory listing etc that way can avoid passing ivypatterns and artifactpatterns around everywhere 
SATD	 remove kotlin predicate after updating the wrapper 
SATD	 closes the tooling api releasing all resources blocks until completed pmay attempt expire some all daemons started this tooling api client the exact behaviour here and not guaranteed the expiration best effort only this method may return before the daemons have stoppedp pnote this not yet part the public tooling api yetp todo need model this long running operation and allow stdout stderr and progress listener supplied todo need define exceptions todo further operations are allowed after this has been called todo cancel current operations block until complete todo introduce tooling api client interface and move this method there 
SATD	 todo use something more stable than cast here 
SATD	 todo make this more intelligent matching the attributes the runtime usage the variant identities 
SATD	 workaround for backwards compatibility previously this case would unintentionally cause the method invoked the owner continue below 
SATD	 todo capitalise the target name the task name todo dont create launch target for library 
SATD	 create binaries for test suites todo this should really componentbinaries rule but this point have clue what the concrete binary type everything has duplicated specific plugins see usages for example 
SATD	 did already consider output after the previous execution 
SATD	 todo get rid this need functionalsourceset instance here and thats surprisingly difficult get 
SATD	 todo generic model related super exception 
SATD	 todo this should work for any build rather than just included build 
SATD	 workaround for 
SATD	 todo basically dont support copying custom javadoc options 
SATD	 todo this exists because detect all available native tool chains system clang gcc swiftc msvc many our old tests assume that available tool chains can compile manymost languages they not try restrict the required set tool chains the swiftc tool chain can build only swift tests that expect use the swiftc tool chain properly annotate their requirements with versionspecific requirement our multitest runner smart enough disable tests that not meet the tests requirements but since many the old tests not have requirements assume the tests require like tool chain gcc clang msvc the future want back old tests and annotate them with tool chains requirements 
SATD	 dont handle variables the moment because users didnt request yet and would probably push add support the tooling api retrieve the variable mappings 
SATD	 todo versionselector should more descriptive can directly translated 
SATD	 todolptr should contentless inputdirectory 
SATD	 todo need smarter way map usage artifact classifier 
SATD	 todo once source compatibility raised this should rewritten using the javaniofilesystem api which can deal with jars and folders the same way instead duplicating code 
SATD	 todo better exception 
SATD	 todo this method accepts closure instance parameter but does not work correctly for 
SATD	 todo find better way present this information the error message attempt mimic gradle nested exception output 
SATD	 todo should really find better solution for this maybe could use filterreader instead filterinputstream 
SATD	 not fully accurate but sensible fallback see 
SATD	 todo not sure can clean the generics here and less unchecked casting 
SATD	 todo deal with more than one header dir generated public headers 
SATD	 todo projectdependency should transformed based defaultproject and other context elsewhere 
SATD	 todo this will have changed when support setting credentials directly the authentication 
SATD	 todo this approximation know swift currently supports only bit runtimes eventually well want query for this 
SATD	 todo the async work tracker should wait for children operation finish first should not necessary call here 
SATD	 todo reduce duplication with binary 
SATD	 todo this should more specific just the tasks that create the class files 
SATD	 todo arent considering the filter 
SATD	 todo exception when type cannot created 
SATD	 todo bind with the sourcecompatibility property todo link runtime configuration 
SATD	 track this input since the scala compiler output may depend todo this should replaced property the scala toolchain soon model these 
SATD	 todolptr instead the first view property should figure out these parameters from the actual property 
SATD	 todo dsl documentation 
SATD	 todo can probably now support more versions with strictly but well need more test coverage 
SATD	 todo move this objectfactory 
SATD	 there are some exceptions attached the suite lets make sure they are reported the user this may happen for example when suite initialisation fails and tests are executed 
SATD	 todo does static library have runtime elements 
SATD	 todolptr this ignores changes projectbuilddir after model node has been created 
SATD	 todolptr remove projection for reference node this shouldnt needed but theres actual value referenced model report can only show the type the node this for now should use the schema instead find 
SATD	 todo what this errors 
SATD	 remove this 
SATD	 todo remove this special case 
SATD	 need move those implicit jvm args that contain space the gradle commandline possible note that this isnt strictly correct some system properties can only set jvm start should change the implementation deal with these properly 
SATD	 doesnt really make sense 
SATD	 typeonly model reference type ambiguous multiple model elements are available for this typen created created 
SATD	 todo exceptions thrown here should point some extensive documentation the concept class rule sources 
SATD	 todo move this base plugin setup the dependency the main binary this should all replaced single dependency that points some testable variants the main binary 
SATD	 todo should support this adds void propnameobject value method that simply delegates the converting setter method 
SATD	 todo send message workers change their log level rather than stopping 
SATD	 todo this should also using the decorating instantiator but cannot for backwards compatibility 
SATD	 todo visit the contents this collection instead this just super simple implementation for now 
SATD	 todo should get rid this reflection will need reimplement the parser act the metadata directly 
SATD	 todo want keep using sourcedirectoryset the new api would feel more natural dirs could added directly languagesourceset could also think about extending sourcedirectoryset 
SATD	 todolptr this should removed once binarycontainer modelmap need also implement all the interfaces the delegate type because otherwise binarycontainer wont recognize managed binaries binaryspecinternal 
SATD	 todo stream serialised value file todo handle hash collisions properly this time todo dont store null links child blocks leaf index blocks todo align block boundaries todo thread safety control todo merge small values into single data block todo discard when file corrupt todo include data directly index entry when serializer can guarantee small fixed sized data todo free list leaks disk space todo merge adjacent free blocks todo use more efficient lookup for free block with nearest size 
SATD	 todo binaries arent input this rule theyre input the action 
SATD	 specifies how build and where place native executable file ptodohh resolve naming conflict with existing 
SATD	 this should replaced some stronger modelling and made open rather than hardcoding set source languages here 
SATD	 moved the api back into internal this isnt really correct 
SATD	 todo refactor this action out can unit tested 
SATD	 todo error there are unknowns 
SATD	 todoadam using uuid means create classloader hierarchy for each daemon process talk instead use the spec decide whether reuse classloader 
SATD	 todo should supply and check for the same parameters passed reservenewclient 
SATD	 todo should use the install task for executable 
SATD	 implement this you need specify individual toolchains via 
SATD	 todo annotate required 
SATD	 todo cannot enable this assertion because modulesource not serialized doesnt appear the deserialized form assert 
SATD	 todo excluderule value object but dont enforce immutability for defaultexcluderule strong should expose the map should provide better api for excluderule dont want use unmodifiable map soon defaultexcluderule truly immutable dont need create new instance defaultexcluderule 
SATD	 production code should handle these exceptions more gracefully 
SATD	 todo this isnt quite right 
SATD	 the isempty check not required might look innocent but guavas performance bad for empty immutable list because still creates inner class for iterator which delegates array iterator which does nothing just adding this check has significant impact because most components not declare any capability 
SATD	 todo add quotes both formats there will lots tests failing not sure worth 
SATD	 todoew consider whether this belongs buildprogressarea here 
SATD	 todo would better these were added via separate managed view rather than hard coded 
SATD	 shouldnt really here currently this goal used link bindallreferences which also expects the subject bound 
SATD	 this doesnt work used because the bottom the hierarchy chain the object implemented methodmissing however our normal decorated classes not this not realistic 
SATD	 todo this returns the wrong public type for domain objects created with the eager apis added directly the container this can leak internal types not currently keep track the type used when creating domain object via create the type the container when domain object added directly via add 
SATD	 todolptr what happens when the property has multiple accessors the same role but with different type 
SATD	 todo should not ignoring dependencyattribute modifications after resolve 
SATD	 todo this should container platforms 
SATD	 todo hack avoid classloading issues should use currently cant use reliably because causes cnf issues with cross version integration tests running against tooling api 
SATD	 todo else verify that the build definition the same 
SATD	 todo make this lazy 
SATD	 todo should this take object 
SATD	 used the kotlindsl base plugin todo remove this 
SATD	 todo sources not actual input binaries its input each binary 
SATD	 todo mix groovy support using bytecode decoration instead todo validate closure parameters check they are within bounds 
SATD	 todo this class attempts mimic the behavior the output mvn helpeffectivepom instead this class should walk the maven project object model instead parsing the xml 
SATD	 have name foobar and import foofoo this means foobar possibly foofoobar rather than foobar this means cut the dot foobar and foo for import 
SATD	 todo remove this once the above removed 
SATD	 todo only here because kotlin dsl uses this please remove once that fixed 
SATD	 hold the lock while creating the connection not generally good form this instance blocks other threads from creating the connection the same time 
SATD	 currently retains strong references types that are not loaded using this fine for jvm types but problem when custom classloader used which should probably deprecated instead supported 
SATD	 might fail hard here the assumption that something weird happened the daemon however since havent yet started running the build can recover just trying again 
SATD	 todo improve configuration reports 
SATD	 todo turn into set 
SATD	 theres potential problem here that reads from input the background this wont automatically stop when the process over therefore input not closed then this thread will run forever would better ensure that this thread stops when the process does 
SATD	 todo need better job routing messages when there are multiple endpoints this just going forward all queued messages the first waiting endpoint even there are multiple waiting work 
SATD	 create test suite component todo reuse logic from swiftplugin todo component name and extension name arent the same todo should use srcxctestswift the convention add the test suite and extension 
SATD	 not use this its here because some the services this type needs are not easily accessed certain cases and will removed some point use one the other methods instead 
SATD	 workaround for when the task given input file that doesnt exist 
SATD	 todo figure out how get rid origin scope snapshot outputs step 
SATD	 get rid the ivy token are not valid uri characters 
SATD	 todo remove this property once configuration can handle normal file system dependencies 
SATD	 this piece ugliness copies the jaxp xml api provider any from the system classloader heres why when looking for provider jaxp looks for service resource the context classloader which our isolated classloader our classpath above does not contain provider this returns null does contain provider jaxp extracts the classname from the service resource not found jaxp looks for service resource the system classloader this happens include all the application classes specified the classpath the application classpath does not contain provider this returns null does contain provider jaxp extracts the implementation classname from the service resource not found jaxp uses default classname jaxp attempts load the provider using the context classloader which our isolated classloader this fine the classname came from step blows the classname came from step workaround locate and make visible xml parser classes from the system classloader our isolated classloader note that practise this only triggered when running our tests 
SATD	 todo will implemented without hardcoded access for 
SATD	 todo this hardcodes the assumption compile configuration the external module instead should creating api configuration for each resolved module 
SATD	 this legacy quirk scans use this determine that progress logging indicating startfinish tasks this can removed gradle along with the concept logging category operation 
SATD	 see the comment taskcompleted above for why this here and why this problem 
SATD	 todo the special casing virtual platform should away can implement disambiguation variants for single component 
SATD	 todo this should actually extend from the api dependencies but since swift currently requires all dependencies treated like api dependencies with transitivity just use the implementation dependencies here see 
SATD	 todo replace this with jvmassembly once that type public 
SATD	 this not very nice might good enough until get rid and friends avoid traversing the graph causing the full resolveddependency graph loaded for the most typical scenario 
SATD	 not implemented not yet required please implement required 
SATD	 todo extract the nonfilesystem parts the into separate interface this isnt really tied file system watching just need another type waiter 
SATD	 todo this class sources gradle metadata files but theres corresponding for this metadata yet because this will generate empty instance either ivy maven based the repository type 
SATD	 todo this isnt correct assumes that side effect add the element 
SATD	 todo classes should little more tied the classesdirs for sourceset every plugin doesnt need this 
SATD	 this really not cool but cannot rely readattributes because will throw exception the file missing which really incredibly slow just determine file exists not 
SATD	 todo use twirl library instead 
SATD	 not use this constructor directly its only there for backwards compatibility with the nebula plugin 
SATD	 groovy does something very strange here for some reason probably because the class java wont employ any dynamism even implementing invokemethod the java level has effect 
SATD	 todo change set 
SATD	 tododaniel should support better way multi file invocation override this method have multi file invocation 
SATD	 todo refactor this task configuration extend copy task and use replace tokens 
SATD	 todoreuse refactor after removing reuse this horrendously bad need set the platform before the defaults rules nativebinaryrules assign the toolchain cant just assign the toolchain here because the initializer would closing over the toolchain which not reusable and this breaks model reuse here are just closing over the safely reusable things and then using proper dependencies for the tool chain registry unfortunately cant the create action because that would fire after defaults rules have use defaults rule assign the tool chain because needs there user mutate rules least the file locations that they can tweaked 
SATD	 check enum equality without checking loading classloader there slight risk that two versions the same enum class are compared thats why classloaders are used equality checks but checking both name and ordinal should make this very unlikely 
SATD	 todo version could different from main artifacts version 
SATD	 should really parameter the withcontent methods baked into the accessor 
SATD	 todo error messages todo display names for this container and the provider implementations 
SATD	 not subtypes dont know whether they are immutable not 
SATD	 todo this check should really done the compiler process 
SATD	 forced dependencies are only supported for enforced platforms currently hardcoded should want add this first class concept gradle metadata then should available the component variant metadata well 
SATD	 todo remove this attempt guess packaging from artifacts packaging should come from component explicitly set 
SATD	 was created during execution 
SATD	 todo deprecate and eventually prevent these mutations when already resolved 
SATD	 todo this doesnt quite guarantee immutability because the source may holding closures that are doing god knows what 
SATD	 todo get rid entirely and replace with collection link outputs 
SATD	 todo migrate this the worker api once the filesystem and fileoperations services can injected 
SATD	 todolptr have the paths the projects serve input maybe 
SATD	 this could handled just not implemented yet 
SATD	 todo wrong using the full classpath the application 
SATD	 this not very beautiful but some point will get rid favor the writable resource 
SATD	 this bit cheesy but letter classname surely means generic type and the warning will useless 
SATD	 creates instance the given task type without invoking its constructors this used recreate task instance from the instant execution cache review this 
SATD	 todo this selection should happen per target platform 
SATD	 todo resolve the javaplatform and scalaplatform from their platformresolvers rather than instantiating directly 
SATD	 todo should include some context what the rule was trying create mutate 
SATD	 todo get this from somewhere else 
SATD	 this here trigger creation the shutdowncoordinator could this nicer way 
SATD	 todopm move this when scope changed 
SATD	 todo outputeventlistener and buildstandardinput are perbuild settings down the road should refactor the code accordingly and potentially attach them 
SATD	 platform specific arguments todo need lazily configure compile task 
SATD	 this occurs while running gradle running integration tests indicative problem this occurs while running unit tests then either use the the usesnativeservices annotation 
SATD	 ugly but there are few places where need instantiate javadebugoptions and regular objectfactory service not available 
SATD	 todo adding the parent project first because the converter needs this way atm this oversimplified the converter should not depend the order reactor projects should add coverage for nested multiproject builds with multiple parents 
SATD	 theres possibility that this listener called concurrently with the build finished listener the message happens graceful expire one then theres large risk that create deadlock because were trying remove the same listener from different notifications avoid this just set the reference null which says that were taking care removing the listener 
SATD	 todo need track tool 
SATD	 todo change this only add swiftapi artifacts and instead parse modulemaps discover compile task inputs 
SATD	 rough implementation get something work 
SATD	 todo this not great paradigm for creating temporary directory see for alternative 
SATD	 todo this should part the cached result 
SATD	 implementation currently dumb can made smarter 
SATD	 todorbo clarify what means and whats possible with todorbo can the return value always used resolve back the identified component how todorbo wouldnt better define proper type for projectmodel paths 
SATD	 todo this can throw npe will need identifier for variant without owning component 
SATD	 this implementation broken does not consider include and exclude patterns 
SATD	 todo lja using the root the nodestate here bit cheat investigate can track the proper nodestate 
SATD	 produces artifactidentifier for this artifact its not actually identifier just bucket attributes todoadam remove this 
SATD	 todo property order needs deterministic across jvm invocations sort the properties name 
SATD	 todo this will leave invalid types the cache when fails 
SATD	 should repositories able participate incremental the least they may able express themselves output files they might have input files and other dependencies well though inputs the credentials they need may expressed file dependencies cant think case here 
SATD	 todo have much better here 
SATD	 todo these should moved off separate type 
SATD	 todolptr this should defaults each 
SATD	 todo should refactor this general compatibility mapping solution have for model loading see class 
SATD	 this heuristic more than truth possible that the long hashs are identical and that the sizes collections are identical but its extremely unlikely never happened test cases even large dependency graph 
SATD	 failing seems that set method override doesnt work for iterables gradle assertthatcall bean list beanthingslist bean new linkedlistobject nullvalue equalto 
SATD	 todo this isnt quite right were leaking the implementation type here but for tasks this usually right 
SATD	 todo return richer data structure that provides meta data about how the source was found for use diagnostics 
SATD	 the configuration has been used resolution and error for build logic change any dependencies exclude rules parent configurations values that will affect the resolved graph 
SATD	 this method sometimes called directly not via operation executor these cases the context null 
SATD	 todolptr what with the metaclass property here 
SATD	 todo this doesnt belong here that java plugin should add extension this guy with this 
SATD	 need make this better 
SATD	 workaround for bug testng apparently fixed some listener notified twice per event 
SATD	 todo this isnt correct this means that weve detected cycle while determining the execution plan but the graph walker did not find one 
SATD	 todocedric the following validation should theory happen its own rule but not possible now because theres way iterate the map subject validate rule without gradle thinking youre trying mutate 
SATD	 todo simplify this class busting into locator for legacy sdks and locators for windows kits 
SATD	 todo this all terribly lame need some proper reporting here which means implementing reporting 
SATD	 todo implement these cases 
SATD	 tododaniel swift compiler should extends from abstraction nativecompiler most applies swiftcompiler 
SATD	 todo should use target platform make this decision 
SATD	 todo there should more explicit way execute action against existing services 
SATD	 have unprocessednew selector for this module need reselect the target version 
SATD	 todo assets should probably source set too 
SATD	 use the class generator instead 
SATD	 todo implement this moving this resolver live alongside the external resolvers 
SATD	 todo this should use the same mutationvalidator infrastructure that use for other mutation types 
SATD	 the cached version still current 
SATD	 todo should just cache these classloaders and ejectstop them when they are longer use 
SATD	 todo should self closed 
SATD	 todolptr should collect all source sets the project source set however this messes 
SATD	 todo only log expired workers count log their identity once they are nameabledescribable 
SATD	 todo this not nice work out better way collect the plugin requests from invoking the plugins block 
SATD	 todo this braindead way ensure that the reference projects model ready access 
SATD	 todo this not quite right given aabb the result should and but will fact and 
SATD	 the very first event starts the initializing phase todo should use determine the build start time 
SATD	 one should really avoid using this constructor totally inefficient and reserved spurious cases when the components have dots names and this can happen task name contains dots 
SATD	 todo bust this hierarchy and compose using interfaces instead 
SATD	 simulate stuck worker theres probably way inject this failure 
SATD	 todo this should outgoing variant the component under test 
SATD	 add install task todo should probably not add this for all executables 
SATD	 todolptr why dont check runningnodes here like hasnodesremaining 
SATD	 dumb terminal doesnt support ansi control codes todo remove this when use terminal rather than jansi render console

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not required but guavas performance bad for empty immutable list 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 unsupported this transformer 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 always schedule the generation task after the clean task 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 theres more than one module merge them into module set 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 some impls support this but not 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 any the child strategies dont expire the daemon the daemon will not expire otherwise the daemon will expire and aggregate the reasons together 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 means the registry didnt exist yet 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not supported 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 there transform for the language into one the component inputs add default source set 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 allows individual identification for debugging 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only print first gradle script stack trace element 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 finalizing here need this run after any assembling task jar link etc created todo convert this binarytasks when model nativeassembly instead wiring compile tasks directly linktask 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 never use empty settings when the settings were explicitly set 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need double check that the target still has hard edges 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 will only add dependencies the leaves there such published module 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont bother searching remotely 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 disallow classes from groovy jar that reference external classes such classes must loaded from will occur essentially this drawing line between the groovy compiler and the groovy 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when provider used task dependency rather than task input need unpack the value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 metadata builder uses mutable project state synchronize access the project state 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this special case for maven snapshots with gradle module metadata when need remap the file name which corresponds the unique timestamp the snapshot version for backwards compatibility 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 part strongly connected component cycle move values root the component the root the first node the component encountered 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add getname 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 remove all the classes other than the main class 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 necessary for groovy compilation pick output regular and joint java compilation and for joint java compilation pick the output regular java compilation assumes that output regular java compilation which not under this tasks control also goes into could configure this source set level but then would end the compile class path every compile task for that source set which may not desirable 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 call directly the delegate avoid some dynamic dispatch 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need sort here since the file order obtained from the filesystem can change between machines and always want have the same shaded jars 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check that the object has already been serialized 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this configuration cannot mutated but some parent configurations provide artifacts

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 order significant injection handler should the end 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 queue this for checking again later 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 all these field names are really long prevent collisions with the groovy setters groovy will try set the private fields given the opportunity this makes much more difficult for this happen accidentally 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 get any errors from the compiler result 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 try infer the effective jvm options for the currently running process only care about managed jvm args anything else unimportant the running build 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add the library and extension 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should use projectstate instead 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the graph contains firstlevel dependencies which have been substituted likely were going iterate dependencies instead 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 reuse the same version last build 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 used just test the mechanism

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add the end the queue that traverse the graph breadthwise order pick many conflicts possible before attempting resolve them 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use the index here can apply any filters the realized element 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this work has done before classes are loaded otherwise there are risks that the permgen space full before create the reflection methods 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 parallel safe version 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 visit the method call because one the args may input method call 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 cant close replaced loaders immediately because their classes may used during shutdown after the return the reload call that caused the loader swapped out have way knowing when the loader actually done with use the request after the request that triggered the reload the trigger point close the replaced loader 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 matches task methodcall operator expression 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 case the output event arrives after completion the test and need have matching descriptor inform the user which test this output belongs will use the current parent

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this hidden property that may useful track down issues remove when ntlm auth solid 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should not happen when reading from stringreader 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generate private metaclass metaclass 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 reach this point means have dependency which doesnt belong the resolution result which can mean two things 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 wrap the processor actor make threadsafe 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 from this point down logging sent back the client 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 java source files are supported too therefore should care about the relative path 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 show any contextual cause recursively 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use arbitrary ordering when the artifacts have the same public attributes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 other home dir cached and not use clean 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 were making assumption here that the targets plugin registry backed classloaderscope because are only buildgradle files right now this holds 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 build configuration for gradleworkermain 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 start logging now that the logging manager connected 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 first try resolve the artifacts locally before going remote 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add the front the queue flush out configurations that are longer required

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the jansiforce property set then force output 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 using the test sources feature introduced eclipse photon 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 flaky 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 mix some groovy dsl support should decorate instead 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont care 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 service calls have effect need register them 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 just serialize string best can

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 see 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 run the build and get the build outcomes model 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 done 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 reach into meta class avoid lookup 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 windows least will sometimes throw odd exceptions like the file gets deleted while the watch being set 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 verify that the parsed descriptor the correct parent module 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need attach failures unattached dependencies too case node wasnt selected all but still want see error message for 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for now only create test suites for static library variants

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 some implementation uses null represent bootstrap classloader 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 ignore currently the actions dont need run its just better they the time this node notified that the task the other build has completed its too late run the action instead the action should attached the task the other build rather than here 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 here will distribute and only least one the distribution operations can simplified 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 find the nearest parent that care about and use that the parent 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when the outputs are generated throw away all state for files that not live appendonly cache this intentionally very simple improved later 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 and class property

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 must run each action 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the other better current not part result 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this shouldnt happen resolvers should call notfound 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 redirect stderr stdout when both stdout and stderr are attached console assume that they are attached the same console this avoids interleaving problems when stdout and stderr end the same location 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 gettype 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should get back some kind reference that can queried below instead looking the task every time 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this the root block can have any number children

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 intentionally not the text 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 which case output stay compatible with existing builds that scan the script for 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 resolving project component can cause traversal other projects which point could release the project lock and allow another task run cant use cache loader here because synchronized the other task also tries resolve project component can block trying get the lock around the loader while still holding the project lock avoid this deadlock check then release the project lock only need resolve the project and ensure that only the thread holding the lock can populate the metadata for project 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the name type remove from the scoping only classvariable only but must removed for each parentscope too 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 layout 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add any finalizers the queue

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 okay have redundant generated isgetters 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this inner class hides the fact that the actual deduplication algorithm stateful 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 were spinning thread work avoid blocking the connection this means that the daemon potentially can multiple things but only allows single build time 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 look into the module node there class with that name 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 type more complicated need check everything 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 register least the project builddir directory deleted 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo use circular buffers avoid copying todo share single initializer with multichannelqueue 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nothing default 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 kotlin boolean accessor methods where the name the getter starts with and the name the setter starts with set are represented properties which have the same name the getter method boolean properties are visible with prefix kotlin this code assumes all configurable boolean property getters follow the prefix convention

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 locked the same process treat locked another process 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 endjupiterexample 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 absolutely need avoid polluting the project with classinfo from our classloader this class must not call any dynamic groovy code this means must what follows using good old java reflection 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 gcc windows requires the path set 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 jarname format 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 continue 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 disable command line file for now because some custom assemblers dont understand the same arguments gcc 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 particular this about gstrings 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should retain this the metadata rather than calculate each invocation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 collect this early the process current directory can change during embedded test execution 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 task properties 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 can try sending something the daemon and try out really dead use jps hes really dead should deregister not already deregistered the daemon not dead might continue receiving from him and try find the bug messaging infrastructure 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 crash 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generate getconvention 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 node and any subclass resolving will then take place elsewhere 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 set the context classloader the bootstrap classloader work around how jaxp locates implementation classes this should ensure that the jaxp classes provided the jvm are used rather than some other implementation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 delete the coverage file before the task executes dont append leftover file from the last execution this makes the task cacheable even multiple jvms write same destination file when executing tests parallel the jacoco agent supports writing parallel the same file see

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 either resolvable expression nonempty unresolvable expression collect ignore includes with value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 deployments are considered outofdate until initial execution with file watching 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when the component defines precompiled header need check the precompiled header the first header the source file for source files that not include the precompiled header the first file emit warning for source files that include the precompiled header mark them source file for pch the native compiler then adds the appropriate compiler arguments for those source files that can use pch 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 object name 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 body expression with one more arguments 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 always publish process info for multirequest workers 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the platform doesnt exist were building lenient one

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 idea doesnt like the result filetouri use the absolute path instead 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 version isnt used except human looking the output jps 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 tool chains can build for this platform assemble description why 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need use the deprecated constructor compatible with certain previous versions the zinc compiler 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need compile all secondary routes fooroutes before primary routes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not our name mangling find inner class the type because this case are resolving the name different place already 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 pallows the container configured creating missing objects they are referencedp ptodo example usagep param configureclosure the closure configure this container with return this 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 ends with 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this agent should loaded via the custom system classloader 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 update the cache entry the index this resets the age the cached entry zero 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should excluded 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 still updated with reason when version remains the same 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check for duplicate entries java and resources 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use throwable record the location where suffix was registered allow diagnostics when collision found this may have performance implications however the assumption that class generators are global scoped objects that are created once and very small numbers 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 strategy mutations will not require reresolve 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 maven local 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 adds void propnameclosure method that delegates model state 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 print something verify after task execution 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this used only retain strong references the values 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 windows needs additional backslash jar urls 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add line before the first question that has been asked the user this makes the assumption that all questions happen together which for now would better allow this handler ask the output renderers show blank line before the prompt not already present 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should not happen 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 versions before would throw away the cause there was also regression 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this cannot because need iterate reverse which requires atomically getting iterator and the size moreover iterate this list far more often that mutate making albeit home grown copyonwrite strategy more appealing 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 more unused label try resize 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 some poms depend themselves through their parent pom dont add this dependency since ivy doesnt allow this example 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 assuming the message has correct format not bullet proof but seems work for now 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nested instance 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use the origin file when can satisfy the basename requirements 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 must not use interrupt because would automatically close the connection sending data from interrupted thread automatically closes the connection 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 eagerly calculate the file this will used dependency some task this avoid having lock the project when consuming task another project runs 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 legacy mode for internal apis 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 clear previous traversal state any 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 notify threads that may waiting this task complete this required because although all builds may share the same coordination service the something may have changed event that fired when task this build completes happens before the state tracked here updated and the worker threads the consuming build may think the task has not completed and back sleep waiting for some other event happen which may not signalling again here means that all worker threads all builds will woken which can expensive would much better avoid duplicating the task state here and instead have the task executors communicate directly with each other possibly via some abstraction that represents the task outcome 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont want support flag true syntax 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 execute the health check that should send out daemonexpiration event the daemon unhealthy 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this artifact asked for particular dependency

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 otherwise keep lock open 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 because zerror 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 work backwards from highest version return the first candidate with qualified version and release status candidate with unqualified version 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 externals are mapped linked resources just need name the resource without full path non unique folder names are naively deduped adding parent filename prefix till unique since this seems like rare edge case this simple approach should enough 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use the abi the hash 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need defer loading zincsbtscala classes until are running the compiler daemon and have them the class path 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generate superpropnamev 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this point need the component metadata because may declare attributes that are needed for matching component metadata may not necessarily hit the network there custom component metadata supplier

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 edge states are deduplicated this performance optimization 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only remove edges that come from different node than the source the dependency going back pending the edges from the from will removed first 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 coercion expensive process cache the result coercing other attribute types can afford using hashmap here because attributes are interned and their lifetime doesnt exceed build 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 detach the process from the parent terminalconsole 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this the first time weve seen the module register with conflict resolver 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo whenever allow user services injected this would have know from which classloader need load the service

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for example skipped foobarbaz uptodate but not 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 maintain hierarchy all progress operations progress heads this forest not just tree 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 already have hard dependency this optional dependency not pending

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 see the grammar outofdate way its supergrammars gleaned from parsing the grammar file 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this performance optimization most modules not declare capabilities instead systematically registering implicit capability for each module that see only consider modules which declare capabilities they then try find module which provides the same capability that module has been found then register otherwise have nothing this avoids most registrations

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 start task execution necessary this required for building plugin artifacts since these are built ondemand prior the regular start signal for included builds 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only expand the thread pool there work the queue know that work about submitted force true 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 from this point down the daemon busy 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 callables 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 new module replacement module weve seen already register conflict and return 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 builds old model resolved dependency graph based the result events 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 any available swift compiler 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have not visited this node yet push its successors onto the queue front this node and visit them 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this special case for backwards compatibility possible have cycle where the root component depends library which transitively depends different version the root module this case effectively allow modules have the same capability filter the nodes coming from transitive dependencies 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 any the input values are not available for this selection ignore the rule 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 throw new viewtypeclass 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add description only the first module 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 order significant 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when writing file into the filestore marker file with this suffix written alongside then removed after the write this used detect partially written files due serious crash and silently clean them 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 any available visual studio 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the file names passed are canonicalised the jvm when creates the system classloader and the file names are lost they happen refer links for example into the gradle artifact cache try reconstitute the file names from the system classpath 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 can null tests resolvestate cannot mocked can null tests componentstate cannot mocked 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generate args 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only use for system javagroovy classes arbitrary use the build classpath will result classjar leaks 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 snapshot poms use snapshot instead the timestamp version validate against the expected 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need resolve type parameters the method from the same class 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 any available visual studio 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 throw away all state between builds 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note this here override the default groovy collectionfindall method 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not yet implemented 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 collect only the shortest paths 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this configuration child toadd need add 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 reached the end input worker has exited without failing 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont evaluate children see know its without validating 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 collect any container level add actions then add the object specific action 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should ask the annotation handler figure this out instead 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 transient fields 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have alter the type the artifact match what published 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 cannot configure slfj logger this will happen tests are executed with custom classloader using tests are run with modulepath effectively hiding gradle classes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 any available visual studio 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 then 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 search the standard installation locations 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not consider injecting constructors public api 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for now requires implies prefers and strictly implies requires only publish the defining constraint 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 clear the users environment 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 order optimised for humans looking the log 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 where the transform class loaded from 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for test suites including suitelike custom runners the test suite class matches the filter run the entire suite instead filtering away its contents 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not holding the cache lock flush done notify flush thread and continue 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 attribute name 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 include file graph for this source file has not changed skip this file 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when deriving variants for the java ecosystem actually have components mixed together the library and the platform and theres way figure out what was the intent when was published derive variants but also need use generic javaapi and javaruntime attributes instead more precise javaapijars and javaruntimejars because the platform aspect which arent jars but something using javaapijars for the library part and javaapi for the platform would lead selection the platform when dont want them other words single component cannot mix precise usages with more generic ones 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 there are only enough entries make block move the entries the left sibling into this block and discard the left sibling might also need merge the parent 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 jgit properties work from their relocated locations and conflict they are left place 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 attempt determine whether the compiler the correct implementation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont know about this kind archive task 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 compile all secondary routes files first 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 read configuration from stdin 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 since need access the method and that its weakly referenced always need double check that hasnt been collected 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 found the first project dependency 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the java plugin applied want express that the compile and runtime variants are mapped some attributes which can used the version mapping strategy this only required for pom publication because the variants have implicit attributes that want explicit for matching 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 fail fast this should not happen 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only unpack one level providers since providerprovider not supported dont need two levels laziness 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 must prepare bind inputs first 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 one more followed one more nonwildcard matches above 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 already handled elsewhere 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 close all streams and redirect 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 theres more than group merge them into group set 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 keeps the class set analysis the given javacompile task 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this test class should loaded via the custom system classloader 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 thisgetclass 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 implementation classpath has been provided just use the application classloader 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 read entire response 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 didnt find node path 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 already invoking method the mixin 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 compare static selectors semantically 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 remove compile and ast types from the groovy loader 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 now handle dirs 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have visited all this nodes successors 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 kotlin passes these types for its own basic types 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 subclass hook allowing fake the context for testing 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 enhance already reported failures 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 checks candidate project dependent the origin project with given configuration 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 will removed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 replacement candidates are the only important candidates 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only cache the result parsing the maven settings files but allow this value updated inflight via system properties this allows the local maven repo overridden when publishing maven see 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 fact check here for 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 inject missing interfaces support the usage plugins compiled with older gradle versions normal gradle build does this adding the the class loader hierarchy test run which essentially plain java application the classpath flattened and injected into the system class loader and there exists gradle class loader hierarchy the running test see implementation and gradleworkermain thus inject the missing interfaces directly into the system class loader used load all classes the test 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need lock the cache order write the module metadata store 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 put var foo the stack push the constant class onto the stack push int interpreted true false onto the stack 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 optimization first check the method name among the candidates before construct equivalence wrapper 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need perform the actual resolve 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 else unchanged check next file 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 fall back standard out 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 token concatenation only allowed inside define body arbitrary tokens wont resolve include path treat both these cases unresolvable include directive 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 track currently associated label with its progress operation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 couldnt find registration for the given type 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 creating before locking have create the most flexible setup 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 try reconstruct the exception 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 attempt merge with the right sibling 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have exclusive lock whether asked for not 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 already the front not the front need recreate 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 copy configuration from parent descriptor 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 setter methods for the above assume weve defined them 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 list modules based metadata files but only wont check for mavenmetadata which preferred 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 used integration tests 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 endcustomtaskclass 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note there deliberately internal synchronizing caching this level class generation should performed behind managedproxyfactory 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should use instantiatorfactory instead pick some validation but this currently somewhat expensive 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo add other build like files buildgradlekts settingsgradlekts other gradle gradleproperties 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 something else may have removed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 changed since last execution possibly another task 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this can happen when method fails which this method depends 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dynamicobjecthelper init return dynamicobjecthelper 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 transforms not require project state 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the only reason for this unit test verify that being thrown when many patterns are passed getpatternsmatcher see 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo intset 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generate public conventionmapping 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make sure can store order well have surprises deserialization 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 inputslvar inputsfield 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 default packages not contain classes like these 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 include the display name anyway 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 endcustomtaskclass 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 its important that not block waiting for the lock while holding the project mutation lock doing can lead deadlocks 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 ignored class ignore the event dont get testignored events for each method have generate them our own 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 package private accessor used for performance reasons 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 filecollection isa iterable buildable and check before checking for these things 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 there least one candidate which does not provide this attribute 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 matches task 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo validations method synthetic bridge methods varargs abstract native 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 non leading 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 already seen this class skip 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 iterate over unicode characters 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 get the metadata first see its there 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should use some variation defaultclassmap below associate values with classes currently retain strong reference each value for one session after the classloader for the entrys key discarded which unnecessary because wont attempt locate the entry again once the classloader has been discarded 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when the artifacts declared component are modified for publishing then the maven publication longer represents the underlying java component instead publishing incorrect metadata fail any attempt publish the module metadata the long term will likely prevent any modification artifacts added from component instead will make easier modify the components produced project allowing the published metadata accurately reflect the local component metadata 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 sourceset has access configurations where could ask for lenient view this means have deal with possible dependency resolution issues here catch and log the exceptions here that the eclipse model can generated even there are unresolvable dependencies defined the configuration can probably better inspecting the runtime classpath and finding out which configurations are part and only traversing any extra file collections manually 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 remove the daemon starting message 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need take copy prevent 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 ignore overrides object and groovyobject methods 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this default ever changed ensure the documentation pathsensitive updated well this guide 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 index the artifact set the the artifact set but reversed when sort order dependency first 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 important return must closed when done with 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check jar exists 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add all included builds from the commandline 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 absolute coordinate system 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 done writing data release any resources 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 assume all the other compilers are they happen installed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the public result for the configuration has been calculated error change anything that would change the dependencies artifacts 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 jvm args that must used for the build jvm 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generate args instanceof object args new object args 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 tag name 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generate public metaclass getmetaclass 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this should pass the time 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generate public convention getconvention return 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 callable extends 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 reuse parent label possible 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need ensure that the conflict orderly injected the list conflicts brand new conflict goes the end find any matching conflict have hook with 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 any swift compiler 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nothing since the only side effect that wouldnt able log the plugin descriptor file name shouldnt reasonable scenario where this occurs since these descriptors should generated from real files 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 there known last descriptor associate with the root test suite 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this internal option its used options the backdoor switch used set described comment helper this option was introduced jdk and controls compilers name tables should reused without this option being set they are stored static list using soft references which can lead memory pressure and performance deterioration when using the daemon especially when using small heap and building large project due bug instances sharednametable are actually ever reused has been fixed for jdk and should consider not using this option with jdk not using will quite probably improve the performance compilation using this option leads significant performance improvements when using daemon and compiling java sources with jdk and jdk 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 cleanup 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 there nothing done 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note used generated subtypes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 invalid lock state need real resolution gather locking failures 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 apply strategies for all variants 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not single candidate 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 exclude the dependencies already provided scalacontainer prevents problems with eclipse scala plugin 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 sibling node 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when the state changes shouldrun the dependencies need reprocessed since they also may required now 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 node must the predecessor state before calculating dependencies 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note populates the generationplans map 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 path prefix 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 since use the main source set need make sure the compile classpath and runtime classpath are properly configured 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add files static archive creating required dont write message standard error when creating archive create object file index equivalent running ranlib 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 trailing slash name indicates entry directory 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 exclude tasks from buildsrc 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 initialize and collect any new outgoing edges this node 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont need anything 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 select the first variant 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 already hold the project lock for this project 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 initial state only path and some projections are known here all projections are defined private data has been created initial rules discovered default values have been applied 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the worker has not reported memory usage yet for some reason does not support 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for example hey skipped foobarbaz uptodate but not foo 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 without the parent hangs without receiving the message above flushing does not help 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 save name before redirect 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 send endofline this workaround convince the console that the cursor the start the line avoid indenting the next line text that displayed would better for the console listen for stuff read from stdin that would also echoed the output and update its state based this 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 wrap the result processor chain blocking actor make the whole thing threadsafe 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 httpclient used parameter public method 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 path descendant this 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 overrides the global currently need have the parent parameter 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 resolve the dependency graph 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have matching component that was rejected these are handled later the resolution process after conflict resolution not failure this stage 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont serialize the causes well serialize them separately later 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 variants 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nothing found second pass 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 autoapplied plugins available 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 ignore the node the other builds execution graph takes care this 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only there are conf defined sub elements 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 new top level node implicitly finish the previous node 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use eclipseproject reference project 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when running test daemon executer the input buffered until newline char received 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 could better job figuring this out 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 theory dont need the synchronized here but lets safer the beginning 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 maven repos are handled mavenplugin 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 ignore inner classes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 avoid iterating candidates theres requested attribute 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 fail fast 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 run any actions addmodify dependencies 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 keep until the listener created 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need wrap all dependencies force them 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 configures the project and all its subprojects including task discovery and binding model rules 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 since java version should instead however keep backward compatibility change from 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 that dont miss out default tasks 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 macos assume colocated xcode installed into optxcode and default location need search for clang differently macos because need know the xcode version for support 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 clean the interrupted status because some test class processors work here junitplatform 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 iterate from the inner most the outer and check for classes this check will ignore class property for example integerclass will propertyexpression with the classexpression integer objectexpression 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 there setter for this property 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 know that were running singlethreaded here can use lenient project locking 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use static private methods because privateprotected methods are disallowed managed types 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 path iterable but dont want unpack 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 source file has changed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 skip prebuilt libraries 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 methods 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not attached console 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 broke out the comparison because there was difference can reuse the snapshot the new element 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 else throw away 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 any the ansi sequences 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 modelregistry methods 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add assemble task for each binary and also wire the development binary the assemble task 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 configure verbosely only arguments not specify any log level 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the selector failed the module has been deselected not attach 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 see 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 always assume candidate from lock will satisfy the latest version selector 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 map the arguments the argument from this expression 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 mix groovy dsl 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 class root package should not happen 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 with lower case letter anymore 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this published artifact 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 cancel opwrite selection 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 user likely doesnt care about daemons that stopped long time ago 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 mappings between public and impl types the list mappings grows should move data structure 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 remove the handler 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 precompute the hashcode its going used anyway and this object used key several hash maps 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 any available gcc implementation including mingw cygwin but not clang 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note this may temporary measure while existing infrastructure being ported managed model elements 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 invoke the setter method pick type coercion 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 end 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 know its archive but not what kind archive know its artifact but thats all know for sure 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 adding optional dependency see already have hard dependency the same module 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generate public returntype settertype returntype supersetterv prop true return 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 rewrite the method call match closure which what the delegate will 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 filter imported classes which are not available yet 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this method returns the dependencies buckets projects first then modules then files because thats what used since would better return the dependencies the same order they come from the resolver but well need change all the tests for that defer that until later 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 must higher than this scope needs cache repository services 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 guard against edge cases junit classes with custom runners that report the class ignored after reporting started 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 default xcode installation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 another thread holds the lock release the project lock and wait for the other thread finish 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 transitive dependency 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 all dependencies visited 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 limit the inner class lookups here using this way only the name will change the packageprefix will not included the lookup the case where the packageprefix really class handled elsewhere warning this code does not expect class that has static inner class defaultimports 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 started update the log level 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not number abd 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 same value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 else ignore abstract methods nonabstract classes some other tooling the groovy compiler has decided this 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add the source the source set the include paths resolve any headers that may source directories 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have visited all consumers visit this node 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check custom packaging 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 library executable 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 matches task arg taskarg 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 end the stream 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 thrown when jna cannot initialize the native stuff 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 throws 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check type extends factory extends elementtype 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 could support unfiltered directoryfiletree here cacheable root but because outputdirectory also doesnt support choose not 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 these are here just that projectinternal can implement fileoperations work around 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this substitution effectively force 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 without this http client prohibits multiple redirects the same location within the same context 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not provided older client versions 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo locking around this state 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 look for parameter substitutions 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 getpropertythis name 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 eventually convert manifest content utf before handing javautiljarmanifest 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 resolve now 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the name the test class 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 annotation processor detected need force java stub generation the can process annotations groovy classes are forcing stub generation tricking the groovy compiler into thinking there are java files compile all java files are just passed the compile method the javacompiler and arent processed internally the groovy compiler since were maintaining our own list java files independent whats passed the groovy compiler adding nonexistent java file the sources wont cause any issues 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 pass compile everything except buildscript pluginrepositories and plugin requests then run 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 update timestamp that working directory not garbage collected 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 find first position where values are different 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 keep the ordering had earlier gradle versions 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 all localcached options failed get directly 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should use stronger modelling for this and make the set tools open rather than hardcoding here 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 remove pdb file present 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo enable this default when toolversion its stable enough 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 target module can change this called the result module replacement conflict 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for project dependencies deduplication ignore scope purpose ignore version because maven doesnt support dependencies with different versions different scopes ignore exclusions because dont know how choosemerge them consequence that use the highest version and the exclusions highest priority dependency when deduplicating use maven dependency management key discriminator 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 import checks that stack not empty 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 write plain content stdout and rich content stderr 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 allow the publication participate incremental build 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nonnull when the result visiting this file can reused 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 determine the actual sources cleancompile 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 register fact that antlr should run before compiling 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 read and verify count 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have cmap should become map 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 these versions couldnt handle milestone patches 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only when this node has transitive incoming edge 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo given that all the closures are from the same file should the relativising once that would entail adding location information the model outer closure 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 avoiding implement costly visitor and potentially missing edge cases 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 default assume your unix tty can handle ansi codes just wrap that when get closed reset the 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 else ignore 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 calculated demand 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the operation hasnt finished normally because shortcut error close without cache key 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 isopen was added gradle for default true 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 used only defaultconf not used for 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 context the app under test 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont anything here older consumers call this method when the project connection closed but then later attempt reuse the connection 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generate 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 strategy changes parent configuration not affect this configuration any its children any way 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use the jars when nothing has been requested 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 create our own metainf which runs after mainspecs files 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 unrecognized expression extra stuff after the expression possibly another expression 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check each unique edge the include file graph 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 then use attribute specific mapping 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 toadd child implies this configuration 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 elements that may may not interesting only for build dependency calculation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 readonly nested property with managed type 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 currently only track the major version 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 convert the file urls cached jar files 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 using transforming classloader only required for older buggy groovy versions 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 calling overloaded method with extra behavior 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 theres ambiguity but may have several variants matching the requested capabilities here were going check the candidates theres single one strictly matching the requested capabilities 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add these separate specs they are not affected the changes the main spec 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 path within its build including project path path within the build tree including project path path the owning build 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 compatible daemons available start new daemon 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 probably facing jdk 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generate 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 badly formed arguments 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 new value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 look for provider with that name 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 list modules based metadata files artifact version not considered 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this safety net its unsure whether this can happen because its likely certain that for specific module resolve state all selectors are the same type 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 conflict resolution choose the best out current selection and candidate 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 remove slfj error out like class path contains multiple slfj bindings see 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 that the state node when was selected but the selection violates constraint reject strictly 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 assuming that the diagnostics were printed out the last line its not bulletproof but seems doing fine 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 versions before would log configure successful for modelaction execution but build failed for tasktest execution 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 any line except the bottom most one new line simply move the cursor the next row note the next row has lower index 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 visit the edges after sorting the components consumerfirst order 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not include implicit builds workspace 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 choose explicit variant 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 preserve logging headers for progress operations started outside the build operation executor was done gradle 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 exclusions optimizations 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use linkedlist for reasons set proved have significant negative impact performance and list will see lot removals which arraylist isnt very well suited for 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only keep track removed options that were present the command line 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 something happened but dont know what 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 cannot clean progress markers progress files here because the file system visitor stuff cant handle the file system mutating while visiting 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use gradleproject reference project 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check see there are any compatible idle daemons 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 maven adds inherited dependencies last 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 system class skip 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 never swallow javalangerror 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 remove the expiring daemon message 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make sure that map only contains booleantrue and booleanfalse values and other boolean instances this necessary because the compile spec doesnt preserve but creates new instances 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the contract usecache means have provide some basic synchronization 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this means that the signature was not required and couldnt generate the signature most likely projectrequired false and there signatory just noop 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 parsing state 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 first step find entry with the explicit inputs the cache 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 try deserialize the original exception 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 special case some common combinations names and paths 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 with multiple unclassified artifacts choose the one with extension matching pom packaging 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 disallow instance fields this doesnt guarantee that the object immutable just makes less likely might tighten this constraint also disallow any code immutable types that reaches out static state 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 restore only there was save operation first 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nothing found locally try remote search for all resolve states that were not yet searched remotely 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 empty path might match when more elements added 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 implements methodmixin not attempt locate opaque method this expensive 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 get only the first element here nothing else but collection forces use iterator 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add constructor 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the changes about the interfaces methods will reported already 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont really need launch the daemon acquire information needed for buildenvironment 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 order for the groovy stubs have annotation processors invoked against them they must compiled source classes compiled result being the sourcepath not have the annotation processor run against them 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 provide implicit empty argument 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 create build configuration the project level from all targets build configuration 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when implementing propertymixin not check for opaque properties this can expensive 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 all them were rejected 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 object methodmissingstring name object args 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not jar not test 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 redraw every entry this area 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this fine just ignore 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo some representation state the inputs 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 prefer use the actual memory usage reported the worker 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 order use newer version jna the resources must not available the old location 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 exit early are reusing the create actions from the provider 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this shouldnt the case however start and complete events are filtered the prior stage when the logging level lifecycle should instead move the filtering after this stage 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 allow currently executing and enforced tasks complete but skip everything else 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generate 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 target 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generate object unpackstate state new objectsize statex propfield return state

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 mark the connection has being handled 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 remove classes from core gradle api 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 matches task methodcall 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 largest free block too small 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this potential nested rule visit method parameters 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this workaround until this story completed hardcoding setting the idle timeout max mins this way avoid potential runaway daemons that steal resources linux and break builds windows 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generated script class name must unique take advantage this avoid delegation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 count from left screen left most count from bottom screen bottom most from bottom 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need update pending count outside withlocks that dont have race condition where the pending count but child worker lease still held when the parent lease released 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 must classrule use the rules class name instead 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 default push the local cache 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 copied from 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 will flush any unterminated lines out synchronously 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 default mapping found for this configuration map configuration itself 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check there are any transitive incoming edges all dont traverse not 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 thead tdblocktd tddescriptiontd thead 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 were asking for runtime variant prefer jars first 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 gradlebuild tasks operate with their own build session and tree scope therefore they have their own this prevents them from reusing the build cache configuration defined the root there way detect that gradle instance represents gradlebuild invocation there were that would better heuristic than this 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generate new object args 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 logging exception here only needed because default gradle does not show the stack trace 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add attributes applied given the extension 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 were asking for api variant prefer jars first for runtime 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nothing 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 always append new line eof 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 stop super and this 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont generate method its not part the view schema 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have through uriish and back deal with differences between how java file and git implement file uris 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only check for the last byte multibyte line separator besides this always check for 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nonheap spaces are not garbage collected 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 capture all output lazily until two new lines and endoftask designation

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note that compileclasspath here approximation and must fixed before deincubating see 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this means the client has not reported memory usage yet 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 first let antlr preprocess the grammars 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note currently extract this information from the execution plan because its buried under functions filter this could detangledsimplified introducing analog this too drastic change for the stage the release cycle were exposing this information was necessary therefore the minimal change solution was implemented 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when cancelled try stop the download thread but dont attempt wait for complete could possibly loop here for while trying force the thread exit 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 possibly inner class 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 file loop exceptions are ignored when encounter loop via symbolic links continue include all the other files apart from the loop this way include each file only once 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when dependency resolution has failed dont want the build operation listeners fail well because the failed method will have been called with the user facing error such error may still lead valid dependency graph

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 using the caches for these connections leaves the jar files open dont use the cache that the jar file closed when the stream closed below there are other options for solving this that may more performant however class inspected this way once and the result reused this approach probably fine

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make sure all entries are always written the same order 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need compute hash for constant which based the name the constant its value otherwise miss the case where class defines several constants with the same value when two values are switched nonprivate const 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 tries minimize the number requests the resolution engine batching requests for sourcesjavadoc there still some inefficiency because the artifactcollection interface does not provide detailed failure results have fall back the more expensive resolutionresult api should fix this other ide vendors will face the same problem

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not marked nullable because groovy compiler bug 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this happens for ibm jdk for nested interfaces see lets try return something close possible the intended value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not public evaluation these specs major hot spot for large builds use array for iteration 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 expire compatible idle not recently used daemons after short time 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the values are based what have found and zinc documentation hard say what effect they have the incremental build 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not zip file

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add outgoing configurations and publications 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 eliminate the common root 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the strategy for sharing build cache configuration across included builds composite requires that the cache configuration finalized and cache controller available before configuring them this achieves that 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 pass build jvm args through daemon via system property the launcher jvm 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 look into the compile unit there class with that name 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when used input add the producing tasks known 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 changes yet handle case where monotonic clock isnt monotonic

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 serialize the worker config this consumed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 values from jvmpackagenametest 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 allow the gradle version overridden for tests that are sensitive the version and need test with various different version patterns use env variable because these are easy set daemon startup whereas system properties are scrubbed daemon startup

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 mark all affected configurations observed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 filtering place 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 these will also copied across any daemon used 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 exactly visual studio 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this approach should generally work because the moment reset capturing output per suite see and that reset happens earlier the chain theory when suite completed the output redirector has been already stopped and there shouldnt any output events passed see also gradle 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when daemon process has started yet 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this workaround for 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dummy rule cause the extension realized 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the registered nodes may contain nodes which are longer selected dont remove them from the list the first place because proved slower than filtering needed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this necessary because for the tooling api compatibility runner nativeservices can get initialized different classloader which then makes broken and unusable the test class because the native shared library loaded from another classloader initializing here ensure that loaded from the classloader the test class also uses 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generate public extensioncontainer getextensions return getconvention

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when not running from gradle distro need runtime impl for launcher plus the search path look for other modules 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 avoid silent retry 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 skipwhenempty implies incremental this file property empty then clean the previously generated outputs that means that there very close relation between the file property and the output 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 cannot compute task execution time because need association with source set

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 could precomputed but avoid doing attributes are never requested 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 its often the case that all the candidate values are the same this case avoid the creation set and just iterate until find different value then only this case lazily initialize set and collect all the candidate values 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 adding custom test listeners before gradles listeners this way custom listeners are more powerful and for example they can change test status 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 some validation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo match with status order versions correctly 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check other behaviour still works 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check already resolved results for compatible version and use for this dependency rather than reresolving

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 its intersection and this method always called the remainder reduction operation the remainder empty then means that the intersection empty 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 any available gcc compatible implementation including mingw cygwin and clang 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when annotation processing isnt required its better add the groovy stubs part the source path this allows compilations complete faster because only the groovy stubs that are needed the java source are compiled 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note there isnt much can about collectionmatching filters the spec requires realized element unless make major changes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 presence capabilities bound the definition capabilities extension the project 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not change the order members used hash code here its been empirically tested reduce the number collisions large dependency graph performance test

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 must add the implicit capability here because assumed that theres rule addcapability would effectively add capability the implicit one must not forgotten 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 stop handling disconnects blocks until the handler has finished stop the connection this means that the thread receiving from the connection will receive null and finish stop receiving incoming messages blocks until the receive thread has finished this will notify the stdin and receive queues signal end input stop the receive queue unblock any threads blocked receive stop handling stdin blocks until the handler has finished discards any queued input

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this should really string object however properties loader signature expects string string even practice was never enforced one can pass other property types such boolean fixing the method signature would binary breaking change public api 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 ignore files 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the current target project component must unmodified from the requested 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this means that receive output before even starting any class too late dont have place for such output any the reports skipping unfortunately this happens pretty often with current level testng support because output events emitted constructor beforetest beforeclass are sent before test start event started and there parent class event emitted testng short the testng support could better see also 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 after this point only see getters

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add toolsjar the systemclassloader parent 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 java and kotlin lambdas are coerced sam types compile time unpacking necessary there 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 these methods return strings rather than types because may more complicated than what able expressed via modeltype also dont want encourage compatibility checking occurring looping through such types have more options for optimising the compatibility check internally also also these methods are only called for reporting values should typically not precomputed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this only required avoid adding new public constructor the public patternset type

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 literal followed followed literal matches above 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 now try each address 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need wrap the visitor that the file seen the visitor has already been extracted from the archive and not try extract again its unsafe keep the filevisitdetails provided tarfiletree directly because not expect visit the same paths again after extracting everything 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note this method taskinternal 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when artifact being published first checked whether available transport returns null then assumed that artifact does not exist throw attempt publish will fail altogether even use

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont write the rightmost column some consoles the cursor will wrap the next line and currently wrapping causes layout weirdness 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not store the history there was failure and the outputs did not change since then the next execution can incremental for example the current execution fails because compile failure and for the next execution the source file fixed only the one changed source file needs compiled

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 perform conflict resolution 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 caches the list dependency states which are not excluded 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 relative coordinate system 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the first call getconfiguration done before getderivedvariants called then means were using the legacy matching without attributes and that the metadata construct should not include the constraints keep the constraints the descriptors because actually use attribute matching can select the platform variant which does use constraints 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 synchronizes the system properties because ivysettings iterates over them without taking defensive copy this can fail another process sets system property that moment

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not substitute plugins from same build builds that were not explicitly included 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 noinspection 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this approximation all compiled sources will use the same task dependency 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 shorten args and write out optionstxt file this must called only once per execute 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this point the workinprogress area may may not have been resized due maximum size constraint 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 using string instead plain here might look strange but this turned out the fastest several experiments including using moduleidentifier initial implementation using moduleidentifier through for interning using level map group then name using interned string for the cachedid interning turned out cost much what gain from faster checks maps and none them reached the performance just using good old string 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 copy the raw form 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not use timestamp that the same the end the last build the start this build 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when using keep the old behaviour all file inputs being incremental

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 throws exception 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this set represents the order which elements are inserted the store either actual provided construct correct iteration order from this set 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 yeah setting the background intensity not underlining but its best can using the windows console api

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo mix groovy dsl support 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 order important here because they will searched that order 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 adds action which executed before this collection mutated with the addition removal elements any exception thrown the action will veto the mutation todo combine this with the mutationguard rework behave with the mutation validators used only expect used with addremove methods and fail when correctly try also prevent allwithtypeetc mutation methods only used addremove methods but should remove this special handling and fix and 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 null the constructorselector says its 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 create log file 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 show all operation output when debug enabled 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 transition any other nodes that depend the predecessor state 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 element names can only contain colon see the name has prefix evaluate both prefix and name 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 coerce the value the property type known 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 very expensive when the property not known instead reach into the meta class call much more efficient lookup method since this hot code path also reuse the argument array used for the reflective call save memory 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont collect build dependencies not required 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 please keep the formatting below helps enabling disabling stages optimizes for nulls params mandatory caches the result operations performs algebra caches the result optimization operations the end the chain mandatory shares the same caches the top level one after reducing can find already cached merge operations 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not part the public api 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 cleanup old html report directories 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 fix problems updating jar files disabling default caching url connections urlconnection default caching should disabled since causes jar file locking issues and jvm crashes updating jar files changes jar files wont noticed all cases when caching enabled leaves the jarfile instance open urlconnection caching enabled 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 here means that have validated that the entry still uptodate and that means couple things the cache policy said that the entry still valid for example refreshdependencies wasnt called the rule cacheable have validated that its discovered inputs are still the same

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 remembers the unresolved dependency for later logging and also adds fake file dependency with the file path pointing the attempted component selector this shows the ide red flag the dependencies view thats not the best usability and also muddies the api contract because disguise unresolved dependency file dependency even though that file really doesnt exist instead when generating files the command line the logged warning enough when using the tooling api dedicated unresolved dependency object would better and could shown notification the command line warning should probably omitted that case

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 caching involves distinct caches that scripts with the same hash classpath not get compiled twice first look for cache script which path hash matches this cache invalidated when the compile classpath the script changes then look into the cache for generic script with the same hash that will remapped the script class name both caches can closed directly after use because for the script changes its compile classpath changes different directory will used for the script changes different cache used the classpath changes the cache invalidated but classes are remapped anyway never directly used

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 logging 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont know the parent will use the top suite this way always have and attach logging events for 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the old value better fit than the new one lets ignore the new one altogether 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 important not add until after has been applied there can pluginswithtype callbacks waiting build what the plugin did 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 choose the main artifact based its type 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 type super

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 unspecified 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 synthesise test for the broken configuration method 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 see 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should provide gradle version parameter this check can more precise 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need work with the string version the usage attribute since this expected for all providers the schema 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 queue this for checking again later this done because were checking what have locally cache and there may nothing were queuing back that the next time check remote access

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 safety check dispatching message should not cause the thread dispatch another message should not any logging 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this logger has been replaced for example using gradleuselogger dont log anything 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 below does not help windows environments was unable get plain javadoc utility work successfully with multiline options the options file least will work out the box linux mac environments windows the options file will have correct contents according the javadoc spec but may not work the failure will exactly the same didnt replace line breaks 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 that logging gets its way the daemon log 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only functioncall argslist supported 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 explicit flush systemerr autoflushing printwriter unless replaced 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont need generate subclass 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note cant conclude anything the label scrolled leave the erasing the parent widget

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this performance optimization dependency states are deduplicated 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 rewrite the method call match closure which what the delegate will 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont attach any labels 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have visited this nodes dependencies add the end the plan 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need gradle core pick ant logging adapter antbuilder and such

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 commit all changes the working tree 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not yet supported for implicit included builds 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 default behavior always buildable binary implementations should define what criteria make them buildable not 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only merge about the same capability otherwise last wins 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 goal has previously been achieved longer required 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 compare dynamic selectors lexicographically 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 handle tree 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 gettype annotation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 once the root build starts configuring are configuring phase 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 discard state that longer required 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 does not override equals but hashcode order cache the latters precomputed value improve performance when used hashmaps 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when this function has parameters dont need substitute parameters return the expression after macro expanding also handle calling zero args function also dont need substitute parameters 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use options file pass across application classpath 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the plugin has already been added 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 empty rhs 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the event has logging header doesnt manifest console output 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 same classes may found different classpath treesjars and keep only the first one 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have add these after the system properties they can override any system properties identical properties later the command line override earlier ones 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont merge anything the iws yet kept the logic for the sake consistency and compatibility with pre ways configuring idea information 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the last comment line the timestamp 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont need lock anything until use the caches 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 handle failure 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 detect transformation the classpath need recompile because could typically facing the case where entries are reversed the order classpath elements and one class that was shadowing the other now visible

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have not visited the successor node add the queue for visiting 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 build events 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 would normally log level higher than equal lifecycle but the ant message priority actually lower than the set lifecycle log level 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need parameter substitution return the value the expression after parameter substitutions and macro expanding the result 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 prefer selector that strictly matches the selected version 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 cached resolved executables 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 buffer was still full after nonblocking retries now block 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 capture log all failures 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 authstate has been established and this put post request add preemptive authorisation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 consumer didnt express any preferences everything fits 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 catch any unchecked exceptions and add the file path for troubleshooting 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 historic note this class still uses the groovy jsonbuilder was originally developed groovy class 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this workaround for several early typed operations have buildpath property the value which can only determined after the settings file for the build has loaded the workaround buffer all operation notifications memory until the root builds settings have loaded this works because all possible settings files have been evaluated the time the root one has been this not guaranteed hold into the future proper solution would change the operation detailsresults truly immutable and convey values known the time 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 create client that will not match any existing daemons will always startup new one 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 try the owner 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 includes trailing 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only share artifactset the artifacts are not filtered the dependency 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make sure hash codes are serializable with single byte length 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the first directory the one created used the default output directory for processed resources 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for tests default method interface might not able get the implementation class directly this case need retrieve test plan get the real implementation class 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 just read the state region 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo move this propertyvalue instead 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the value true output file false parent output file 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 matches task identifier taskidentifier 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 hackery 
SATD	 todo extensions like flex mojos use custom scopes like merged internal external etc order dont break backwardcompat with those only warn but dont error out 
SATD	 todo this needs accept link returned link but its not used like that 
SATD	 its the building the grandchild project having already cached the child project but not the parent project which causes the problem 
SATD	 todo would like get rid this jvz 
SATD	 note this should considered quirk support interop with mavens legacy artifactdeployer which processes one artifact time and hence cannot associate the artifacts from the same project use the same timestampbuildno for the snapshot versions allowing the caller pass metadata from previous deployment allows reestablish the association between the artifacts the same project 
SATD	 todo really wondering where this method belongs smells like should mavenproject but for some reason isnt this localization kindof code smell 
SATD	 todo hack because metadata isnt generated correctly and want run the maven have the 
SATD	 todo this does not belong here 
SATD	 this foul 
SATD	 note theres and 
SATD	 derive the path portion the given url param url the repository url return the basedir the repository todo need url decode for spaces 
SATD	 todo restore these makes sense 
SATD	 todo could the configuration passed lookup and the configurator known plexus via the descriptor that this method could entirely handled plexus lookup 
SATD	 todo error reporting 
SATD	 todo this replacing shouldnt necessary userhome should the 
SATD	 todo currently this first wins but really should take the latest comparing either the snapshot timestamp some other timestamp later encoded into the metadata todo this needs repeated here the merging doesnt interfere with the written metadata wed much better having pristine input and ongoing metadata for merging instead 
SATD	 todo what about wildcards just specifying groups versions 
SATD	 todo use stringutils here 
SATD	 todo from concurrency perspective this class not good the combination mutableimmutable state not nice 
SATD	 todo probably want warn the user that building artifact with different values than 
SATD	 not sure this last regexp was really intended disallow the usage network paths userhome directory unfortunately did removed and have not detected any problems yet path pathreplaceall 
SATD	 todo better way than static this might hide messages reactor 
SATD	 this exception thrown application attempts attach two the same artifacts single project author pgier author jdcasey todo make this checked exception and modify the api mavenprojecthelper currently this modification would create compatibility problems for existing plugins 
SATD	 todo lifecycles being executed todo what runs each phase todo plugins that need downloading todo project dependencies that need downloading todo unfortunately the plugins need downloaded order get the pluginxml file need externalize this from the plugin archive todo this will the class that people get ides modify 
SATD	 note for plugins that depend other plugin artifacts the plugin realm contains more than one plugin descriptor however only the first descriptor interest 
SATD	 todo not sure about this here and may want getlog here wellinstead 
SATD	 todo does this check need happen here had add the same call below when iterate child nodes will that suffice 
SATD	 todo mng changes likely made this redundant 
SATD	 todo move this plexusutils pathtool 
SATD	 find the version this total hack see previous comment 
SATD	 note this primarily keep backwardcompat with maven which did not validate that dependencies are unique within single pom upon multiple declarations just kept the last one but retained the order the first occurrence when were lenientcompat mode have deal with such broken poms and mimic the way works when were strict mode the removal duplicates just saves other merging steps from aftereffects and bogus error messages 
SATD	 todo validate for 
SATD	 mng neither have reserved all the above magic expressions nor their set fixedwellknown gets occasionally extended newer maven versions this imposes the risk for existing plugins unintentionally use such magic expression for ordinary system property here check whether ended with magic value that not compatible with the type the configured mojo parameter string could still converted the configurator leave those alone back off evaluating the expression from properties only 
SATD	 this not ideal but there are events specifically for configuration from the cli which dont believe are really valid but there are its which assert the right events are published this needs supported the eventspydispatcher needs put the clirequest that can accessed configuration processors 
SATD	 todo could use map maybe the parent did that for components too this too vulnerable 
SATD	 todo current policy retain the original version this correct need strategies that handled elsewhere 
SATD	 todo the configuration for the lifecycle needs externalized that can use the annotations properly for the wiring and reference and external source for the lifecycle configuration 
SATD	 todo similar test should created test the dependency management basically all usages are affected mng 
SATD	 todo shouldnt the versions merged across relocations 
SATD	 todo this should not need handed off 
SATD	 note this will not hit for maven projectxml incompatible schema 
SATD	 todo push all common bits back plexus cli and prepare for transition guice dont need ways make clis 
SATD	 metadata resolution exceptions 
SATD	 todo why this using the context 
SATD	 todo jul check this were using and there are aggregator tasks this will result weirdness 
SATD	 validate versions arent inherited when using parent ranges the same way when read externally 
SATD	 todo need externalize clirequest 
SATD	 should get whole slew dependencies resolving this artifact transitively 
SATD	 note should not inheriting status since this assessment the pom quality note should not inheriting relocation since this relates single pom 
SATD	 todo could more efficient sorting the list and then moving along the restrictions order 
SATD	 set the recommended version todo maybe its better just pass the range through retrieval and use transformation 
SATD	 there are too many dont know which one run report the error 
SATD	 any 
SATD	 exception that occurs when artifact file used but has not been resolved author portera todo may better for artifactgetfile throw perhaps runtime exception 
SATD	 todo log message throw exception 
SATD	 note this exists merely for backwardcompat with legacystyle lifecycle definitions and allows configuration injection work instead failing 
SATD	 this class needs stick around because was exposed the the remote resources plugin started using instead getting the repositories from the project 
SATD	 maven quirk artifact always points the local repo regardless whether resolved not 
SATD	 todo optimize maybe just rewrite the whole way aggregating mojos are being run 
SATD	 note getid was added and such not implemented plugins compiled against apis 
SATD	 todo dont catch exception 
SATD	 todo use settings 
SATD	 todo whether duplicates should removed looks like option for the generated merger 
SATD	 todo these two tests display lack symmetry with respect the input which free form string and the mojo descriptor which comes back all the free form parsing needs done somewhere else this really the function the cli and then the preprocessing that output still needs fed into hinting process which helps flesh out the full specification the plugin the plugin manager should only deal concrete terms all version finding mumbo jumbo customization base functionality the plugin manager provides 
SATD	 todo this will the basis the customizable lifecycle execution need figure this out quickly 
SATD	 todo use the following two instead manageartifact todo remove interface 
SATD	 have collected all the problems lets mimic the way the old code worked and just blow right here thats right lets just let rip right here and send big incomprehensible blob text unsuspecting users bad dog 
SATD	 note see mng this causes problem but fixing may break more 
SATD	 fixme this hacky what module directory doesnt match artifactid and parent coming from the repository 
SATD	 note currently unchecked careful removing this trycatch this necessary avoid creating compatibility problems for existing plugins that use 
SATD	 describes version transformation during artifact resolution author portera todo try and refactor remove abstract mainmethods not particular happy about current design 
SATD	 return the required dependencies specified scope todo the name not intelligible 
SATD	 todo shouldnt need double this work only done for simplicity handling recommended 
SATD	 trying give loggers back bad idea ceki said notice self what was this method supposed 
SATD	 todo kristian wonders this class really necessary and overlaps other concepts 
SATD	 todo might better have sourceretrieve throw specific exception for this situation 
SATD	 this really wagon something went wrong after successfully retrieved the metadata 
SATD	 filter exclude from list artifact patterns author portera todo think this equiv exclusion set filter mavencore 
SATD	 todo this only provide project for plugins that dont need project execute but need some the values from mavenproject ideally this should something internal and nothing outside maven 
SATD	 todo why mvn adds dot paths 
SATD	 todo introducing space herenot sure what else but collapse whitespace 
SATD	 igorf way too many declared exceptions 
SATD	 describes repository directory metadata author portera todo not happy about the store method they use this 
SATD	 todo currently cannot tell which section contained the management information when the resolver provides this information these log messages should updated contain 
SATD	 todo hack make the cycle detection the same for the new graph builder 
SATD	 todo the antrun plugin has its own configurator the only plugin that does might need think about how that works todo remove the 
SATD	 todo jvz why isnt all this checking the job the duty the workspace resolver know that have model that suitable yet more checks are done here and the one for the version problematic before because with parents ranges will never work this scenario 
SATD	 todo the order the merged list could controlled attribute the model association targetfirst sourcefirst dominantfirst recessivefirst 
SATD	 todo add better exception 
SATD	 todo let the scope handler deal with this 
SATD	 artifact not things like the stupid dummy artifact coming from surefire 
SATD	 this just silly lookuplist should return empty list 
SATD	 todo this needs colorized 
SATD	 todo whether the merge continues recursively into existing node not could option for the generated merger 
SATD	 specific problems during resolution that want account for limissing metadatali liversion range violationsli liversion circular dependenciesli limissing artifactsli linetworktransfer errorsli lifile system errors permissionsli author jason van zyl todo carlos all these possible hasexceptions and getexceptions mainmethods make the clients too complex requiring long list checks need create for the types exceptions 
SATD	 todo this needs accept link returned link but its not used like that link 
SATD	 mavenapi fixme the dag used not only used represent the dependency relation but also for parent buildplugin reports need multiple dags since dag can only handle type relationship properly usecase this detected cycle parent orgapachemavenmaven inherited reporting dependency this case both the verify and the report goals are called different lifecycle though the compilerplugin has valid usecase although that seems work fine need take versions and lifecycle into account 
SATD	 dont want the artifacts version here this stored the directory above that 
SATD	 use regular expression search find and resolve expressions within the pom author jdcasey created feb todo consolidate this logic with the minus deprecationsbans 
SATD	 fixme filter out the inherited false stuff 
SATD	 todo plugindescriptor classrealm and artifacts are set side effect this call which not nice throws 
SATD	 need set the file here the resolver will fail with npe not fully equipped deal with multiple local repository implementations yet 
SATD	 todo was null really need find them now this taken care the ordering 
SATD	 this wont valid but constructs something easy read the error message 
SATD	 todo this should eventually migrated 
SATD	 note other configurators like the maporiented one dont call into the listener the hard way 
SATD	 wraps active project instance able receive updates from its artifact without affecting the original attributes this artifact author portera todo think this exposes design flaw that the immutable and mutable parts artifact are one class and should split scope file etc depend the context use whereas everything else immutable 
SATD	 some better conventions for the test poms needs created and each these tests that represent verification specification item needs couple lines most the expressions help lot but need clean pick directory poms automatically load them into resolver create the expression extract the data validate the model and the uri validate the properties also need way navigate from the tex specification documents 
SATD	 todo classpath check doesnt belong here thats the other method 
SATD	 todo not entirely the same message 
SATD	 todo this could lot nicer should really the snapshot transformation 
SATD	 todo should this part mediation 
SATD	 fixme somehow report the user that there are too many elements for now ignore the extra 
SATD	 mng hack workaround deficiency legacy api which makes impossible for plugins access the global profile manager which required build pom like cli invocation does failure consider the activated profiles can cause repo declarations lost which turn will result artifact resolution failures particular when using the enhanced local repo which guards access local files based the configured remote repos 
SATD	 todo without this could just evaluate call 
SATD	 builder concurrency and parallelism preserve the existing mainmethods for builder selection which look for various inputs the threading configuration dont have easy way allow pluggable builder provide its own configuration parameters but this sufficient for now ultimately want components like builders provide way extend the command line accept its own configuration parameters 
SATD	 todo ick this forces the oce that should have come from the previous call still 
SATD	 maybe its better move some those mainmethods separate class soc 
SATD	 todo not sure how best set these for this implementation 
SATD	 note this should considered quirk support interop with mavens legacy artifactdeployer which processes one artifact time and hence cannot associate the artifacts from the same project use the same version index allowing the caller pass metadata from previous deployment allows reestablish the association between the artifacts the same project 
SATD	 todo shouldnt need file intermediatary improve wagon take stream 
SATD	 todo should deprecate 
SATD	 shouldnt javasources given the classifier shouldnt false given the classifier 
SATD	 validation error continue project building and delay failing help ides 
SATD	 the bean containing the mojo descriptorbr for more information about the usage tag have look todo there need for the delegation mavenmojodescriptor this why not just extend componentdescriptor here 
SATD	 todo add better exception that can detail the two conflicting artifacts

SATD	 todo also this logging for other metadata 
SATD	 note from empty string and null both denote classifier however some plugins only check for null sure nullify empty classifier 
SATD	 todo not sure that should assume this maybe the calls addmetadata should premerge then artifact replaces 
SATD	 why are just ignoring this exception are exceptions are being used for flow control 
SATD	 todo this too early for build extensions maybe just remove 
SATD	 the workspacereactor flux better not assume definitive information for any its artifactsprojects

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 mng 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when model read from repo stream used then pomfile null has consequences inheritance algorithm since getprojectdirectory returns null 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need get the latest file for the project not the artifact that was created one point time 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 mng 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make copy the original the pom doesnt get messed with

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this has separate statement capture the case dfoobar 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 catch means the transferread succeeded but the checksum doesnt match this could problem with the server ibiblio http error page well try this two times the second try well handle bonafide error based the repositorys checksum checking policy 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 older wagons throw this just get instead 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 same instance from version cache

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 systempath 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 file could not found was not valid start from scratch 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note intentionally only support basedir and not projectbasedir the latter form would suggest that other project expressions can used which however beyond the design

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 conflictresolver mainmethods 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 simple checks first short circuit processing below 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo this checking for file null happens because the resolver has been confused about the root 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for given project packaging find all the plugins that are bound any registered lifecycles the project builder needs now what default plugin information needs merged into pom being built once the pom builder has this plugin information versions can assigned the pom builder because they will have defined plugin management once this setcomplete then can passed back that the default configuration information can populated need know the specific version that can lookup the right version the plugin descriptor which tells what the default configuration 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nonjavadoc see 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 determine the lifecycle that corresponds the given phase 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 probably not worth but here make sure restore request its original state 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 default does nothing

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the pom has file cached missing artifact only return the cached data update forced 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 local wins now and irrelevant not local testprovided arent transitive assertequals check artifactscope 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 mng 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 before update the version the artifact need know whether are working transitive dependency not this allows depmgmt always override transitive dependencies while explicit child override depmgmt viz depmgmt should only provide defaults children but should override transitives can this calling ischildofrootnode the current node 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 leave optional ones but dont pick its dependencies 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 mng

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 mng 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the temporary file named destination tmp and done this way ensure that the temporary file the same file system the destination because the filerenameto operation doesnt really work across file systems will attempt filerenameto for efficiency and atomicity this fails then will use brute force copy and delete the temporary file

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 now that have everything that need will fire plexus and bring the maven component life for use 
SATD	 todo support multiple levels includes 
SATD	 when all nimbodes down and one few them come unfortunately there might not exact way know which one contains the most updated blob 
SATD	 todo this assumes key only from the one field not need have order fields 
SATD	 the following code duplicated the constructor mqttpublisher reproduce here fail the client side ssl misconfigured rather than when the topology deployed the cluster 
SATD	 should remove the third blob because the first has the reset timestamp 
SATD	 get rid multiple url 
SATD	 todo track file offsets instead line number 
SATD	 todo support more configuration options for now were defaulting the hbasexml files found the classpath 
SATD	 this bit ugly but works order maintain the same directory structure that existed before need have storm conf storm jar and storm code shared directory and need set the permissions for that entire directory but the tracking per item basis are going end running the permission modification code once for each blob that downloaded times this case because the permission modification code runs separate process are doing global lock avoid any races between multiple versions running the same time ideally this would per topology basis but that lot harder and the changes run fairly quickly should not big deal 
SATD	 could not find fully compatible version look see there possibly compatible version right below 
SATD	 resourceutilsjava not available the classpath let parse out the resources want 
SATD	 filesmove with nonempty directory doesnt work well windows this not atomic but does work 
SATD	 not thread safe have one instance per producer thread synchronize externally 
SATD	 todo substitution implementation not exactly efficient kind memory 
SATD	 todo need better way this 
SATD	 todo need able set the tick tuple time the message timeout ideally without parameterization 
SATD	 connection unavailable will drop pending messages and let atleastonce message replay kick another option would buffer the messages memory but this option has the risk causing oom errors especially for topologies that disable message acking because dont know whether the connection recovery will succeed not and how long the recovery will take 
SATD	 todo consider adding shuffle grouping after the spout avoid much routing the argsreturninfo all over the place least until its possible just pack bolt logic into the spout itself 
SATD	 this hack for nonras scheduler topology and worker resources 
SATD	 todo move this logic the model class 
SATD	 for some reason the new code ackers null get 
SATD	 this bit hack list then component stream want format this componentstream 
SATD	 todo dry this code with whats 
SATD	 should fail the tuple kill the worker 
SATD	 todo streams should uniquely identifiable 
SATD	 todo would love standardize this 
SATD	 fixme this class can moved webapp once porting done 
SATD	 this isnt strictly necessary but doesnt hurt and ensures that the machine stays date even callbacks dont all work exactly right 
SATD	 work around should get alternative working way 
SATD	 the topology zookeeper authentication configuration unset 
SATD	 read last this should cause evicted next put 
SATD	 todo more collection content type checking 
SATD	 fixme were using default config since cannot serialized still needs provide some options externally 
SATD	 todo this can only ever null someone doing something odd with mocking should really fix the mocking and remove this 
SATD	 todo put some better exception mapping todo move populatecontext filter 
SATD	 should fail the batch kill the worker 
SATD	 getting the exact response code bit more complex todo should use better client 
SATD	 todo should worker even take the topologyid input this should deducible from cluster state searching through assignments what about theres inconsistency assignments but nimbus should guarantee this consistency param conf storm configuration param context param topologyid topology param assignmentid assignment param supervisorport parent supervisor thrift server port param port port which the worker runs param workerid worker 
SATD	 this bit ugly but shows how this would happen worker will use the same apis 
SATD	 fixme stores map topoconf topologycontext and expose these derived classes 
SATD	 original implementation doesnt actually check delete succeeded not 
SATD	 doesnt seem like you should have this but java serialization wacky and doesnt call the default constructor 
SATD	 this bit ugly the json are expecting should the form component resource value but because value coming from json going number and want double the goal through each entry and update accordingly 
SATD	 may though unlikely lose metering here state transition too frequent less than millisecond 
SATD	 want throw exception path doesnt exist 
SATD	 todo better way this would great 
SATD	 todo the future this might better common webapp location 
SATD	 fixme should moved stormclient when can removed 
SATD	 todo figure out how want deal with overrides users may want add streams even when overriding other properties for now just add them blindly which could lead potentially invalid topology 
SATD	 more accurate that threadsleep but still not great 
SATD	 todo ignore the master batch coordinator 
SATD	 this test rather ugly but the only way see the error messages are working correctly 
SATD	 todo need able replace existing fields with the function fields like cascading fieldsreplace 
SATD	 todo wrap this set the stream name 
SATD	 todo this isnt right its not the map anymore 
SATD	 todo add method for drpc stream needs know how automatically return results etc too expensive batch per drpc request 
SATD	 todo the inner join incrementally emitting the cross join with this tuple against all other sides todo only cross join least one tuple each side 
SATD	 todo once everything java this should not possible any more 
SATD	 heck for backward compatibility need pass hbase conf the conf instance instance persistentmap making copy 
SATD	 this hack allow zookeepermain called this command 
SATD	 perhaps there better way this 
SATD	 todo can optimize further only querying backing map for keys not the cache 
SATD	 todo this causing issues 
SATD	 todo need invoke hook provided the topology giving chance create user resources this would part the initialization hook need separate into workercontext and workerusercontext actually just via interfaces just need make sure hide setresource from tasks 
SATD	 not implemented 
SATD	 todo what would good test ensure that least somewhat defensively copied 
SATD	 todo the future want way include this logic the spout itself make unnecessary having storm include metadata about which grouping tuple came from 
SATD	 todo does this work well windows 
SATD	 filecontext supports atomic rename whereas filesystem doesnt 
SATD	 not enough guaranteed use the age the topology instead todo need good way only this once 
SATD	 use parsewithexception instead parse can capture deserialization errors the log they are likely bugs the spout code 
SATD	 todo take away knowledge storms internals here 
SATD	 todo should handle ref 
SATD	 todo make sure test these two functions manual tests 
SATD	 todo get this from type instead hardcoding nimbus establish clientserver transport via plugin 
SATD	 there bug some versions that returns for the uptime 
SATD	 need set active false before calling onkill current implementation does not return 
SATD	 this kind unnecessary for clojure 
SATD	 todo this class reserved for supporting messages with different schemas current only one schema the cache 
SATD	 bad files dir config 
SATD	 fixme can filter listkeys with local blobstore when storm going resolved workaround call getblobmeta for all keys 
SATD	 min this really means something wrong even very slow node 
SATD	 todo check for null grouping args 
SATD	 todo perhaps can adjust the frequency later 
SATD	 reestablish connection eventhub servers using the right offset tbd might optimized with cache 
SATD	 todo handle the case where there may schema 
SATD	 seems safer not follow symlinks since dont expect them here 
SATD	 this because json doesnt allow numbers keys todo replace json with better form encoding 
SATD	 todo optimize this computation perhaps inner loop can outside avoid rescanning tuples 
SATD	 likely because bug try get another way

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 thread safety assumes collectoremit calls are externally synchronized needed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 test for user having write admin privileges change replication blob 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 message was acked after being retried clear the state for that message 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 reset commit timer such that commit happens next call nexttuple 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the retry schedules for two messages should unrelated 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 boltspecific configuration for windowed bolts specify the time interval for generating watermark events watermark event tracks the progress time when tuple timestamp used this config effective only link specified 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 group field 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 stream words emitted the queryspout used the keys query the state 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add supervisors that might have crashed but workers are still alive 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 put owner stormbaselist mapping ownertobasesmap this owner the input parameter null add all the owners with stormbase and guarantees else add only this owner the input paramter the map 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the system low memory cannot kind and need shoot something 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the child processes typically exit sec mins later they are still around something wrong 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only log the leader has changed not interesting otherwise 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 race happened and probably not running 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 required required optional 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 authorize client allowed dorequest and only the client 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this spout added test purpose just failing fast doesnt hurt much 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 minimum version supporting storm would 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 advance the time and replay the failed tuple 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 boltspecific configuration for windowed bolts specify the sliding interval count number tuples 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only need keep track acked tuples commits kafka are controlled tuple acks which happens only for atleastonce processing semantics 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not close this inputstream method will used from jetty server 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 partition ids 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the current assignment already running new assignment will never promoted currassignment because timer not being compared equals equivalent meaning newassignment always equals currassignment 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this happens the min too small 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 config 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should not show files outside worker log root 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 valid delete before whats been committed since those batches will never accessed again 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 client should not sending otherthansasl messages before saslserverhandler has removed itself from the pipeline such nonsasl requests will denied the authorize channel handler the next handler upstream the server pipeline sasl authentication has not completed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 window system state 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 used internally merge values groupbykeyandwindow 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 register the newly established channel 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when storetuplesinstore false then the given windowstorefactory only used store triggers and

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 verify correct unwrapping partitions and delegation assignment 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 meter declared here can registered any daemon and currently used supervisor 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 send flush tuple all local executors 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 include the topology name worker port the file name that multiple event loggers can log independently 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 another kafkaspout instance this topology already committed therefore does not apply 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 adjust the divisor for the average account for any skipped resources those where the total was 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 bolt overrides 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 rate 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 schedule the heartbeat one thread pool 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 ensure the commit timer has expired 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 didnt get the group just return empty list 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 parts for cgroup else maps hierarchy proccgroups 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 yes are putting config that not the same type pulled out 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 replicationfactor 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 cleanup 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 max number window events memory 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 non blocking returns count how many inserts succeeded 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 concurrent deletion only one thread should succeed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 now lets update but not advance time should get old map again 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 remove the unneeded entries from the graph want keep all our nodes and the nodes that they are connected directly parents and children 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have enough resources now 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont emit anything allow configured spout wait strategy kick 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 was scheduled for retry and reemitted remove from schedule 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 onheap 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 filter configured allow anyone 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 setup spout with mock consumer can get the rebalance listener 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note variable used lambda expression should final effectively final will cause compilation error and variable type should implement the serializable interface isnt primitive type will cause not serializable exception 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 hosts this user authorized impersonate from 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 worker crashes the states all workers are rolled back and initstate message sent across the topology that crashed workers can initialize their state the bolts that have their state already initialized need not reinitialized 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 enable 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note that sometimes the tuples active may less than maxspoutpending maxspoutpending active acked there wont commit for because isnt committed yet and there wont batch for because theres maxspoutpending active 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 multivalue field split non default token match dynamic fields the form txt this field wont indexed solr 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 map consisting all workers the node 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 had timeout but the timeout longer active 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 sample fielddescriptor streamxyz 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this odd case for rolling upgrade where the user the old assignment may null but not the new one although all other ways they are the same this happens want use the assignment with the owner 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont override the host name everything looks like nimbus 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this also helpful optimization that state implementations dont need manually 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 sigar uses jni and does not work local mode 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for mesos this hostnametopologyid 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 writablebytechannel channel which implements closeable hence although declared autocloseable superclose here should only throws ioexception rethrow conform the signature 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 retire them 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 create factory class 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 assignmentid 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 assignedmemoffheap 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 topology with multiple spouts 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 populate metric values using the provided key 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 done separately like with setting the 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 since the largest unpinned entry before loaded 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 commits offsets during deactivation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 reason try execute previous attempt than weve already seen 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 pipeline component 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should have been reemitted 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add the event logger details 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 support topologies older version run might have loose the constraints that the configs older version can pass the validation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 there race backpressure too 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 free the error stream buffer 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 name 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 partitioned example case emitter task receives later transaction than its emitted far when sees the earlier txid should know emit nothing 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 some times bolt spout will have some memory that shared between the instances these are typically caches but could anything like static database that memory mapped into the processes these can declared separately and added the bolts and 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 creates mongouri from the given string 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 verify that only committed the message the assigned partition 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this can happen when topology first coming its thrown the blobstore code 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 fall back string which already set 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 there can more then one line cgroups are mounted more then one place but assume the first good enough 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the resource that not used should count being used 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 could block 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 one tuple and one rotation should yield one file with data 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 null acks every tuple 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 explicit delete for ephemeral node ensure this session creates the entry 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the spout must respect even some tuples have been acked but not committed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 projection 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 search all metadata strings 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this should never happen because only the primary nimbus active but just case declare the race safe even lose 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should remove the blob since cache size set really small 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 newreader true and tuple null then empty reader 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 populate user password map with jaas configuration entries from the server section usernames are distinguished from other options prefixing the username with user prefix 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 read remaining lines file then ensure lock gone 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 havent received the entire object yet return and wait for more bytes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 schedule the simple topology first 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 first offset this batch 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this tuple should removed from emitted only inside the ack method this ensure that the offsetmanager for that topicpartition updated and allows commit progression 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add element and bar should drop out 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 below calls shouldnt propagate any exceptions 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 private string timestampfield 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need able lookup bolts then switch based 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 parse the output clear the input stream buffer 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 treat like jar 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this very private and does not need exposed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 fetch records from kinesis starting sequence number for message passed argument any other messages fetched and are the failed queue will also 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 its possible for target have multiple tasks reads multiple sources 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 tests for case when subject null security turned and 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make sure samplingpct within bounds 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 will fail since doesnt implement extend dnstoswitchmapping 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 port range 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 try grab another lock while dir locked 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 schedule tasks that are not part components returned from topologygetspout 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 function call when timer killed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 setup const spout 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 now schedule all the topologies that need scheduled 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 critical path dont use iterators 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 good 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this default ensures things expire most past the expiration time 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this should the load metrics there will usually only one message but there are multiple only process the latest one 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should remove the second blob first 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 get close enough 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 comma separated offsets 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 close file and retry creation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 track serialized size messages 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 map the value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 string does not exist 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 sync the filesystem after every tuples 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for kryo compatibility 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 log median ratios for different strategies 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 grouping assignment node see the nodes diff then notify nodessupervisors synchronize its owned assignment because the number existing assignments small for every scheduling round 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 metric value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 removed since that what going trigger the retry for cleanup 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 level waiting 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 uncompressfalse 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this partition was previously assigned this spout 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add new records kafka and check that the next batch contains these records 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 scheduler histogram 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 precondition the new and current assignments must equivalent 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 submit storm cluster 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for example have three nodessupervisor supervisor supervisor cluster slots before sort supervisor supervisor supervisor supervisor supervisor supervisor supervisor supervisor supervisor slots after sort supervisor supervisor supervisor supervisor supervisor supervisor supervisor supervisor supervisor 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 ignore 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this shouldnt throw check because nothing configured yet 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 drain element and ensure relieved trypublish succeeds 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 save the private worker key away can test too 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 found spout spout 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 taskidindexingbase queue list all recvqs local this worker 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 spoutobject 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the short term the goal not shoot anyone unless really need the heap should limit the memory usage most cases reasonable amount someone using way more than they requested this bug and should not allow 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for native protocol below all variables must bound with native protocol above variables can left unset which case they will ignored server side tombstones will generated 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 location the file the artifactory archive also used name file cache 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 int short 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 migrate the coordinator currtx currattempts and meta directories the new spout expects the list topic partitions coordinator meta 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 implementations 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 emit messages and fail all them then ensure that the spout will retry them when the retry backoff has passed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generate sasl response but only actually send the response 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 overloading the readint method accomodate subject order check for authorization security turned 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 get and set the start time before getting current time order avoid potential race with the gauge 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make sure dont process too frequently

SATD	 bug grizzly needs doc root you are going register multiple adapters 
SATD	 dont need retry this operation the case failure will remove ephemeral files and dont wanna hang this process when closing cannot reconnect 
SATD	 this likely problem means that file reloading broken probably because the directory are watching was deleted otherwise became inaccessible unmounted permissions changed for now log error and exit the watcher thread 
SATD	 fixme this was originally seconds but realistically randomslowvirt hosts there way guarantee this 
SATD	 this bit weird but need return the address and the number bytes distinguish between ipv and ipv 
SATD	 bit hack but delete will never succeed and ensures that the same semantics are maintained

SATD	 todoivmaykov not sure cnxn can null here becomes null channelinactive exceptioncaught trigger but its unclear usereventtriggered can run after either those check for null just safe 
SATD	 could not create tmp directory hold jaas conf file test will fail now 
SATD	 fixme this test assertfailing due client close race condition fixing separate patch for zookeeper this test checks see the sessionid that was created for the first zookeeper client can reused for the second one immidiately after the first client closes and the new client resues them throws ioexception throws throws keeperexception 
SATD	 todo need tune the default value thread size 
SATD	 todo refactor quorumbase special case this 
SATD	 this might not right but its only used for printing connection info the netty implementation its probably 
SATD	 problem before fix after session close the ephemeral node was not getting deleted but now after the fix after session close 
SATD	 observer should write disk that the wont request too old txn from the leader which may lead getting entire snapshot however this may degrade performance has write disk and periodic snapshot which may double the memory requirements 
SATD	 occasionally seen false negatives with timeout 
SATD	 todo investigate why reconfig makes qps null 
SATD	 todo zksprocesspacket changed take bytebuffer could implement zerocopy queueing

SATD	 xxx need anything

SATD	 todo need figure out the security requirement for this 
SATD	 problem follower had one extra ephemeral node 
SATD	 todo the future serverid should validated for all cases not just the case todo however for now would too disruptive 
SATD	 since requests are processed order better get response the first request 
SATD	 this ugly you have better way speak 
SATD	 authentication error occurred during authentication with the zookeeper server 
SATD	 todo brd should either put concurrenthashmap restore use map save 
SATD	 todo this doesnt use quorum verifier 
SATD	 mocked class that doesnt clientside verification beforeafter calling removewatches 
SATD	 this shouldnt necessary wrapping data with string but without there are problems the server hangs for seconds and doesnt get the data todo investigate 
SATD	 try provide hints use about what went wrong they can fix their configuration todo introspect about look for gss information 
SATD	 fixme dont want have serialize here and then immediately deserialize next processor but not sure how else get the txn stored into our list 
SATD	 these internal classes are public but should not generally referenced 
SATD	 fixme ipv not supported using something like guavas hostandport parser would good 
SATD	 this really programmatic error and not something that can happen runtime 
SATD	 add backwards since are pushing into the front only send theres pending watch todo here have the only remaining use zookeeper this class its eliminated 
SATD	 todo rather than checking disjunction here should single member variable method this class determine whether the client configured use sasl see also zookeeper 
SATD	 todo maybe should flush the loop above every packetsbytes but how determine the right value for 
SATD	 need upgrade before can proceed 
SATD	 todo exit server this point 
SATD	 only make copy this thread isnt already holding lock 
SATD	 multiple bad arguments 
SATD	 xxx this doesnt need volatile should probably final 
SATD	 test will still fail even though just logignore 
SATD	 fixme ignore for now 
SATD	 xxx really should not need this 
SATD	 xxx hack 
SATD	 not sure about argwhat 
SATD	 fixme need way more cleanly exceptions 
SATD	 small chance that unexpected message was delivered after this check but would catch that next time 
SATD	 warning this will reset the xutil 
SATD	 little hacky way detect key type but works 
SATD	 the following sequence code stupid you would think that only sockclose needed but alas doesnt work that way you just sockclose there are cases where the socket doesnt actually close 
SATD	 todo not every tmp directory needs this file 
SATD	 xxx this shouldnt needed but just case 
SATD	 bunch constants todo will get rid eventually 
SATD	 todo can not name this method getstate since threadgetstate already exists would cleaner make class sendthread implementation runnable 
SATD	 handle below might harmless the user doesnt intend use jaas authentication 
SATD	 should never call this sasl authentication negotiated session initiation todo consider substituting current implementation direct clientcnxn manipulation with call this method session initiation 
SATD	 note may exceed our max length bit when add the last watch the batch this isnt ideal but makes the code simpler

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 zookeeper dont execute its not enabled 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 set ssl system properties and port unification begin restarting servers 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 now parse 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 exponential backoff 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 and the leader will complete 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nthreads 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 setting the quorum has transaction overhead for creating and closing the session 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 prep the request and convert txn 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 test getexists with two sets watchers 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nonjavadoc 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 once weve figured out where are were done 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 lets see one successful operation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 try reestablish the quorum 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 same for element should refactor this 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make sure zkclient works 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 start server with new config 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 none not ready yet sets saslstate complete sideeffect 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 instead starting rozk immediately wait some grace period before decide were partitioned thread used here because otherwise would require changes each election strategy classes which 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this should never happen 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 logwarnack cxid requestcxid type requesttype requestsessionid requestaddrqrecprop 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this method can return empty iterator the requested zxid 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 log error level are returning marshalling error the user 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have read data from the file and matchs the timep pattern 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 change nothing update 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make sure atomically check local session status upgrade session and make the session creation request this avoid another thread upgrading the session parallel 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for each leader offer find out where fit were first become the leader were not elected the leader attempt stat the offer just less than they exist watch for their failure but they dont become the leader 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 zookeeper provides escape hatch for users upgrading from old versions zookeeper pre 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the follower acceptor thread 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 now kill one the other real servers 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 servers with authentication interfaces configured 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 resets flag 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note mode unknown plaintext 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 disable throttling and resume acceptance new requests this entailed state change register interest update request with 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 and add back follower 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 create file logger url from the command line args 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check delete 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 leader 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 input may delimited either commas newlines convert common newline separated format 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 return number session expiry calls 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 touch table for the global sessions 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 watcher 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 init quorum auth server learner 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 verify bad pass assertfails 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 verifying that other path child watches are not affected 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 start peers and verify they form the cluster 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this server should fail join the quorum not using ssl 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check the path exists cannot create quota for path that already exists zookeeper 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 matching option specified remove the watches the given node choosing watchertypeany 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 version added 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 want loop through the list twice 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 create transaction and snapshot files differentdifferent 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 set watch the root node 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the selector 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note according the socket javadocs settrafficclass may ignored socket implementations dont check that the value set returned 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 execute from commandmap 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 sub process used execute the command 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 now participant asks for epoch mocking learnerhandler behavior second add connectingfollowers triggers true 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 that the switched off servers are down 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 logwarndesignated leader designatedleader 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 creates leader election notification message 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 want send our version the request 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this should enough time for the first session expire and for the closesession request propagate other machines there bug since time sensitive have false negative when test 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 here start populating the server and shutdown the follower after 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 clear our internal buffer 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 access ipmap any set contained the map needs protected with synchronized ipmap 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 choose current server according the client rebalancing algorithm 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 createclose session dont require request record 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 start one lethread for each peer want run 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 grab some memory that easier cause 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 doing delete 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 ensure got connected 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use synchronizedthis access 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 defaults servercnxnfactory would instantiated with 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make sure there leader 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 now create the direct children 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add back servers and while still reconfigmode didnt call 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 create zookeeper and connect 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only import nodeviewers 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 challenge counter avoid replay attacks 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check that the node path removed from ptrie 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 including the header and the last bytes the snapshot should least bytes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 number entries skipped get the end the iterator less the number skipped get the start 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 save the return error code the server 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 change the change this minutes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 authenticate learner 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the test method threw exception but might expected exception defined the test annotation check the annotation and log appropriate message 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 register interest update request with the selector 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this must global request 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 here create znodes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the change should happen now 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 request processors 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 create and register the top level logj mbean 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 test basic create and getdata 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 entries jaasconf theres configuration exception fetching the jaas section and the user has required sasl specifying logincontextnamekey jaas file 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont waste memory there are few watches node rehash when the entry added doubling size thereafter seems like good compromise 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 creating sequential nodes stored properly 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 servers and then bounce the other servers one one 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 than peer zxid 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check that when server starts from old style config should keep the client 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 send the same messages this time should not make the leader 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 start additional new servers 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 pretend each connect attempt takes milliseconds 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 servers and should able work independently 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 weve sent the whole buffer drop the buffer 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 start new connection doesnt have one already 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 watcher 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 send the connection request client 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this value will used directly link codesessionmoved public static final int sessionmoved 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nonjavadoc see 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this just packet from old client which doesnt contain readonly field 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 number machines increased server the new cluster here whether move not depends the difference cluster sizes with probability oldnew the client disconnects 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this case the hostname equals literal address 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 queuedbuffer has reached its component limit combine the existing components 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check being waken closing 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 abort hit the limit 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 start mock server 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 start server again with intact database 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this shouldnt break anything 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 resolve hostname for this server case the underlying address has changed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 lets remove the leader and some other server 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 throw error there were any leaked buffers 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 delete till you can find node with more than one child 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 shutdown leader quorum should still exist 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nonjavadoc javautillist 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 election instance 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 tgt not bother with ticket management 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 each watcher will process the event 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 restart the previous leader force replay the edits and possibly come bad state 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 shutdown followers that leader does not have majority and goes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make sure they joined the new config without any change 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 where the packet actually sent 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 write message 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 get each logger from the logj repository and add the hierarchy mbean created above 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 send snap 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 different larger version dynamic file 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 start the server automatically create the necessary directories and capture the directory where data stored 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 look for the clients finish their create operations 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 default constructor 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 later 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 startforwarding will called all cases 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 send ping request either time due packet sent out within maxsendpinginterval 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 some the operations will executed client connected the removed server while others are invoked client connected some other server when were removing the leader will the client connected removed server 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 again the user explicitly set something saslrelated they probably expected sasl succeed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 content preserved 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check avoid startup follows shutdown 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 sleep for millisecond and then again check 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check the existence name bean 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when local session upgrading disabled leader will reject the ephemeral node creation due session expire however this the follower that issue the request will have the correct error code should use that and report user 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only called callback from 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the test failes will most likely fail with noauth exception before ever gets this assertion 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 loop through the args must keyvalue sequence 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 falls back filename detection property value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 start the followers form new quorum 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 number machines became smaller server not the new cluster 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the node value same what have leader 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check that the static config was split into static and dynamic files correctly 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nonjavadoc see eventeventtype javalangstring 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 signal for graceful shutdown 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 proceed the next processor 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 cleanup 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 halt one the listeners and verify count 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 throttle when there are too many concurrent snapshots being sent observers 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should only happen during upgrade 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check for any parent that has been quota 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 take one the new servers possible there are still such servers didnt try and either the probability tells connect one the new servers already tried all the old servers 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 wont race another upgrade attempt because only one thread will get the timeout from the map 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 findbugs complains about get after put long term strategy would use computeifabsent after jdk 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 jaasconf entry available 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 create the node with another session 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the node doesnt exist anymore skip 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 sid 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the first allowable character 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 during first and second iteration leavingindex will correspond follower during third and fouth iteration leavingindex will the index 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the socket times out count that assertfailed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make sure can handle any type correct wrapper 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the direcotry containing the 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 sets authorization flag 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 setup database with single foo node 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 sun doesnt include the address that causes this exception thrown wrap the exception order capture this critical detail 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check that storage space return some value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 log that precedes first retained snapshot also retained

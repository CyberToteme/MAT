SATD	 xxx really dont like this the xml processor still too involved the processing better solution imo would create for project and target too and then process the tree and have projecttarget deal with its attributes similar with description eventually switch add support for dom things will work smoothly can avoided almost completely could still created demand for backward compatibility 
SATD	 junit wraps solo tests this way can extract the original test name with little hack 
SATD	 xxx ignore attributes different maybe store them 
SATD	 borrowed from tokenfiltertest 
SATD	 xxx move project shared all helpers 
SATD	 what the property supposed 
SATD	 hack for anttype value anttype component name which can namespaced need extract the name and convert from qualified name uriname 
SATD	 theres convenient xsltc class version but data are private use package information 
SATD	 stolen from the xercesj team which ascii characters need escaped 
SATD	 bingo append this should normally not done here 
SATD	 this faintly ridiculous 
SATD	 cannot remove underscores due protected visibility 
SATD	 todo not read yet public setter 
SATD	 not know what the object class has multiple defines but this for logging only 
SATD	 not sure what could the need this 
SATD	 xxx jon skeet any reason for writing message and then using bare runtimeexception rather than just using buildexception here case the message could end being written loggers the loggers could have failed created due this failure 
SATD	 experimentaltesting will removed 
SATD	 xxx should instead make new protectiondomain with codesource corresponding containertouritourl and the same had 
SATD	 this really irritating need way set stuff 
SATD	 xxx all this convert source destination directory according weblogic standards can written better this too hacky 
SATD	 silly hack avoid stack overflow 
SATD	 access property tables this used support ant call and similar tasks should deprecated possible use better more efficient mechanism preserve the context 
SATD	 xxx should throw exception instead 
SATD	 temporary until figure better api 
SATD	 there better way save the context this shouldnt delegate next its for backward compatibility only 
SATD	 quick fix for antjava use property before initializing the project 
SATD	 xxx should use jcvs wwwicecomjcvs instead command line execution that dont rely having native cvs stuff around 
SATD	 two reasons are mentioned the api docs for filelist dir not directory this impossible wouldnt get here this case error occurred why doesnt throw exception then 
SATD	 jakarta commons logging listener note not use the simplelog your logger implementation causes infinite loop since writes systemerr which ant traps and reroutes the loggerlistener layer the following names are used for the log for project events for target events for events individual targets all target and project names replace and with todo should use the advanced context logging features and expose them first todo this very inefficient switching the out and tracking the logs can optimized lot but may require few more changes the core since ant 
SATD	 todo using taskname here brittle user could override this should probably modified use the classname instead 
SATD	 these are pathological cases but retained case somebody subclassed 
SATD	 this rather hairy case one our subclasses knows that need update the archive but the same time there are resources known that would need added only the subclass seems know whats going this happens jar detects that the manifest has changed for example the manifest not part any resources because our support for inline manifests invoke createemptyzip like ant did well loose all stuff that has been the original archive bugzilla report 
SATD	 this deprecated use classespath the future 
SATD	 xxx this array stuff remnant prev trials gotta remove 
SATD	 set the number milliseconds leeway give before deciding target out date todo this not yet used param granularity the granularity used decide target out date 
SATD	 this may change add advanced parsing capabilities 
SATD	 assume that every output jikes does stands for errorwarning xxx this correct 
SATD	 the line below hack the system must uri but not cleat get the uri resource just set the name the resource system 
SATD	 xxx what the following doing should run javadoc executable null 
SATD	 mac and previous todo have idea how get someone must fix 
SATD	 todo nothing appears read this but set using public setter 
SATD	 xxx are committing combiningchar and extender here 
SATD	 xxx failed load the class properly should print warning here 
SATD	 xxx could perhaps also call threadstop not sure anyone cares 
SATD	 xxx perhaps shouldnt use properties for these three options emacs mode warnings and pedantic but include the javac directive 
SATD	 xxx maybe use reflection addpathelement other patterns 
SATD	 todo there problem with the constructor for the rbc you have provide the rules the constructors setters available 
SATD	 probably not the best choice but solves the problem relative paths classpath 
SATD	 fix for invalid characters you think more add the list 
SATD	 fallback case have trouble loading the class dont know how handle there easy way know what idl mode would generate this supposed make ant always recompile the class file that name should not exist 
SATD	 check out also ugly 
SATD	 cant get head around this encoding treatment needed here 
SATD	 quick dirty make nested mapped psets work 
SATD	 xxx this code still necessary there any port pull zip from packages directory 
SATD	 only the developer knows what she doing 
SATD	 xxx unfortunately jdk adds entryset keyset values implementing this requires small hack can add later 
SATD	 first developer could use little help 
SATD	 xxx should silently catch possible exceptions and try load different implementation 
SATD	 since java return normalizedpathsplit workaround for java 
SATD	 hammer end inline maingtu 
SATD	 this array really shouldnt here again for historical purposes pfixme this array should private package private location since could modified malicious codep 
SATD	 should move separate public class and have api add listeners etc 
SATD	 should become single empty argument same for 
SATD	 not very nice but will the job 
SATD	 provide public visibility 
SATD	 not used but public theoretically must remain for 
SATD	 dont want call this method 
SATD	 xxx what this for 
SATD	 keep this have something delete later tests 
SATD	 copied from concattest 
SATD	 not sure whether this clean but this method declared not throw exceptions 
SATD	 just set the prefix for this fileset and pass need this 
SATD	 why nothing 
SATD	 have deal with assembly the programmer can writing little byte chunks for all know and must assemble complete records for writing review maybe this should tarbuffer could that help eliminate some the buffer copying 
SATD	 this the new better way use classespath instead sourcespath the code currently the same you need class files directory use this jar files 
SATD	 xxx why not simply new filedir filename 
SATD	 this ugly checking for the root folder 
SATD	 todo parameterise call compiler class dont want fork again use classic compiler can parameterised 
SATD	 xxx all this get package according weblogic standards can written better this too hacky careful similar code scandir but slightly different 
SATD	 stolen from writemanifest 
SATD	 the jarfile already exists then whack and recreate should probably think more elegant way handle this that case errors dont leave people worse off than when started 
SATD	 xxx the following really necessary the same thread group 
SATD	 have find cleaner way put this output 
SATD	 this the old way and deprecated classespath the right way this and above 
SATD	 for script example that modifies ided tasks other targets work very ugly the reference replaced runtimeconfigurable 
SATD	 dont call superclose because that reader used other places 
SATD	 report error something weird happensthis diagnostic 
SATD	 sorry otherwise will get classcastexception because the mockcache loaded two different classloader 
SATD	 hack ask the create instance voluntarily providing illegal arguments force the run the class static initializer while the same time not running valid constructor 
SATD	 singleton for now may change perclassloader 
SATD	 xxx shouldnt this always return false isolated mode 
SATD	 delete the file not valid file 
SATD	 todo comment field doesnt include all options yet 
SATD	 this method checks the timestamp each file listed the code ejbfilescode and compares them the timestamp the codejarfile code the codejarfilecodes timestamp more recent than each ejb file codetruecode returned otherwise codefalse code returned todo find way check the manifestfile that found naming convention param ejbfiles hashtable ejb classes and other files that will added the completed jar file param jarfile jar file which will contain all the ejb classes and other files return boolean indicating whether not the codejarfilecode date 
SATD	 have think about lazy initialization here jhm comparator new 
SATD	 todo methods yet for getclassname todo method for newinstance using reverseclassloader 
SATD	 the displayname variable stores the value the displayname element from the standard ejb descriptor future enhancement this task may determine the name the ejb jar file using this displayname but this has not implemented yet 
SATD	 output stream that compresses into the bzip format without the file header chars into another stream pthe compression requires large amounts memory thus you should call the link close close method soon possible force release the allocated memoryp pyou can shrink the amount allocated memory and maybe raise the compression speed choosing lower blocksize which turn may cause lower compression ratio you can avoid unnecessary memory allocation avoiding using blocksize which bigger than the size the input pyou can compute the memory usage for compressing the following formulap pre codek blocksizecode pre pto get the memory required for decompression link cbzipinputstream cbzipinputstream usep pre codek blocksizecode pre table width border colgroup col width col width col width colgroup colspanmemory usage blocksizeth trtr usageth usageth trtr alignrightktd alignrightktd alignright ktd trtr alignrightktd alignrightktd alignrightktd trtr alignrightktd alignrightktd alignrightktd trtr alignrightktd alignrightktd alignrightktd trtr alignrightktd alignrightktd alignrightktd trtr alignrightktd alignrightktd alignrightktd trtr alignrightktd alignrightktd alignrightktd trtr alignrightktd alignrightktd alignrightktd trtr alignrightktd alignrightktd alignrightktd table pfor decompression allocates less memory the bzipped input smaller than one blockp pinstances this class are not threadsafep todo update bzip 
SATD	 xxx log error throw exception 
SATD	 todo allow user request the system parent 
SATD	 there was any text before this add fragment todo this check could modified posprev seems like this current version could stick empty strings into the list 
SATD	 xxx add exceptions

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 interestingly enough get here when user uses dnamevalue however some cases the goes ahead and parses this out args dname value instead parsing just make the characters away and skip one argument forward dont know how predict when the jdk going help not simply look for the equals sign 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 special case single jar handling with signedjar attribute set 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 read the dependency cache from the disk 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not cached need read directly from the class file 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 convert the replyto string into vector emailaddresses 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make sure buildfile exists 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should always the case 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 single jar processing 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 optional methods you can override those methods you want optimize advanced things like support special syntax the methods not chain you should use them when embedding ant replacing the main helper 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this class depends each class the dependency list for each one those add this class into their affected classes list 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the capturetosummary test writes stdout and stderr good for verifying that the testlistener support doesnt break anything 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 now determine which jars each class depends upon 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 usually the initialized set true but here must not because the prepend and append readers have instantiated runtime 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 return here 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 also check for properly formed uris ant formerly recommended using nonsense uris such filefooxml xml includes you shouldnt that just fooxml correct but for compatibility specialcase things when the path not absolute and fall back the old parsing behavior

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 build the command line from what got the format history elements specified the ssexe help 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 there are places this file and perhaps elsewhere where assumed that null acceptable parameter 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 just call the and let handle the semantics instantiation retrieval 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 converted from sun internal classes new baseconverter utility class extracted from get task 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 further methods necessary this just amalgamation two other interfaces 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 copying dirs trivial and can done for nonfile resources well for real files 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the singleton 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 simplest case setattribute expects string 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use the logger config 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only default specified and the property did not exist the property file the property set default 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 had child elements need indent before close the element otherwise were the same line and dont need indent 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the key the dictionary but cannot retrieved this usually due references that refer tasks that have not been taskdefed the current run ignore 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 value and default are both specified and the property previously existed the property file the property set value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 write magic done caller who created this stream thisoutwriteb thisoutwritez 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 since task log category includes target dont really need this message 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 property type operations

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 doesnt make sense for use the logger config 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check that suite generates errors 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 could not get the required information 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 are any other references held can close the loader removes the locks jars new one will created 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 finally assign the property with the manifest classpath

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use wrappers for primitive classes int and integer are treated identically 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 one cannot rmic interface for classic rmi jrmp 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 manifests classpath attribute always uses forward slashes and spaceseparated ant will properly format columns with proper line continuation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not use the sun impl for portability and always use our own implementation for consistent testing 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 otherwise perform timestamp comparison least 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 move the generated source file the base directory base directory and sourcebase are the same the generated sources are already place 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 revisit this point even non http connections may support the ifmodifiedsince behaviour just check the date the content and skip the write not newer some protocols ftp dont include dates course 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 source file generated nothing move 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the property the name file are testing location attribute need resolve the given file name the provided folder 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the method called addcreate the nested element 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check that invalid suite generates error 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check create this property already present add takes preference over create for purposes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not the requested type

SATD	 todo better wrap profileexception and throw that 
SATD	 create our bandbuffer which just small slice the image todo used fixed height buffer now but could smarter and compute height which would fit some memory budget allowing use taller buffers with narrower images minimizing the overhead multiple rendering passes 
SATD	 todo support iterate declarator

SATD	 todo how about figassociationclass 
SATD	 todo this shouldnt depend the current project but for now just make sure its defined and that have undo manager 
SATD	 remove this diagram from existence todo move gef 
SATD	 todo this needs managing undo perproject basis instead using gefs global undo manager 
SATD	 todo define constants for magic numbers 
SATD	 this class gives critics access parts the uml model the design defines gen function that returns the children any given part the uml model basically goes from project models modelelements argos critic agency uses this apply critics where appropriate todo this thinks knows all the composition associations the the uml metamodel but incomplete and not updated for uml this should done using information from the metamodel rather than hardwired code tfm see see author jrobbins 
SATD	 todo consider inherited associations todo self loops are double counted 
SATD	 todo multiple associations between the same pair elements need special cased that they dont overlap tfm 
SATD	 gets the current threshold todo should this protected return the current threshold

SATD	 todo what progressmgr used here where does come from 
SATD	 todo here should show the user message that the loaded project was using notation that not currently available and fall back the default notation was done maybe this can implemented the persistencemanager

SATD	 hack for items only should check isleafnode but that includes empty folders really need alwaysleafnode 
SATD	 todo why was this next line the code long 
SATD	 this method has insufficient information call buildextensionpoint thus well need create one and pray that whomever called knows what kind mess they got

SATD	 moves some object trash deletes completely with all dependent structures deleting object involves pre removing target history deleting all fig representations for the object deleting the uml element deleting all dependent uml modelelements deleting commentedges which are not uml elements move trash for enclosed objects graphically drawn top move trash subdiagrams for the object saveguard that there always least diagram left the current diagram has been deleted select new one show trigger the explorer when diagram deleted set the needssave dirty flag the projectmanager pre param obj the object deleted see todo this should just named delete something which better tells what does since there really isnt trash can 
SATD	 changed uml component with subsystem stereotype todo should deprecate this 
SATD	 returns the root package return the package which the root deprecated for tfmorris use link getroots get packagesmodel elements which are the top level todo probably need getdefaultnamespace method something similar replace some uses this 
SATD	 updates the top level modelelements for all projects uml each model knows its root elements this could make setroots obsolete applying stereotype uml adds new root todo this redundant with setrootsgetroots there are already too many ways this stuff managed without adding additional one all current model subsystem implementations know their top level elements responsibility can moved the model subsystem but lets choose one way managing this 
SATD	 datastructure for settings for project most getters return string since they are used argotee this also the reason all these attributes are not part map something todo the header comment currently not used this function not completely implemented yet how store this the project where should the user enter his header comment see issue author michiel 
SATD	 notation settings value object stores settings which control how text rendered diagrams todo this needs diet its used everywhere performance sensitive the current set settings the union all those found the legacy code but its not clear that all them are actually used author tom morris tfmorrisgmailcom 
SATD	 this does calculation where our ext directory todo should eventually make sure that this calculation only present one place the code and not several 
SATD	 contrast link getzipname returns the members name without the prepended name the project but with the extension todo this not used anywhere shall remove author steffen zschaler return the members name without any prefix suffix 
SATD	 todo end with multiple models here 
SATD	 were deleting the last diagram lets create new one todo once mdi wont need this 
SATD	 create notation settings value object with all default values todo this class only has partial undo support basically just those members that had part previous implementation 
SATD	 this code was copied from 
SATD	 this the temporary solution for issue 
SATD	 parse message textual descriptionp todo this method too complex lets break param umlmessage the uml message object apply any changes param the string parse throws parseexception when detects error the attribute string see also 
SATD	 this the temporary solution for issue 
SATD	 todo addonly has been removed uml should phase out support tfm 
SATD	 save the argo entry todo cyclic dependency with persistencemanager move someplace else 
SATD	 empty then were done there cycle the message graph which would bad has more than one element then the model crappy but well just use one them anyway 
SATD	 utility method encode string way that allows saved properly xml file and regained filtering out any noice that xml framework might have seen fit add todo why are doing this ourselves surely encoding information for xml serialization well known task tfm have never understood why this being done think should remove any usage bob param str the string encode return the encoded string 
SATD	 hence less elegant workaround that works 
SATD	 this should probably inside xmireaderparse but there another place this source where xmireader used but appears the nsuml xmireader when argo xmireader used consistently can responsible for loading the listener until then here 
SATD	 critic suggest using the facade stereotype todo the moment only dummy implementation see issue 
SATD	 todo this needed 
SATD	 could this some other type internal error that want handle differently dont think tfm 
SATD	 create and register diagrams for activity and statemachines the models the project other diagrams are created default class diagram will created argouml currently requires least one diagram for proper operation todo move xmifilepersister protected param project the project 
SATD	 load xmi file before any pgml files fixme the following loading the model before anything else due the zargo containing the profiles currently have removed this hack umlfilepersister and think should removed from here also 
SATD	 bufferinputstream that aware xml structure searches for the first occurrence named tag and reads only the data inclusively from that tag the matching end tag can search for the first occurrence named tag and read the child tags the tag not expected empty tag todo this hardwired assume fixed single byte character encoding needs updated handle different encodings including multibyte encodings tfm author bob tarling 
SATD	 todo attempt move the following code gef 
SATD	 todo use stylesheet convert wait till use fig factories diagram subsystem what the last version that used fignote 
SATD	 todo move diagram subsystem 
SATD	 set the fig style attributes todo this should move into the render factories described issue param fig the fig style param attributemap map name value pairs 
SATD	 todo without this fail draw class but this good solution why the layer not set the constructor 
SATD	 todo really want able replace the initial content handler which passed sax but cant this without cloning whole bunch code because its private the super class 
SATD	 fig was created the code above then must look for the old style constructor that should have fallen into disuse now figobject rectangle diagramsettings all these constructors should have been deprecated least and replaced with the new signature this here for paranoia only until all figs have been reviewed 
SATD	 fignodemodelelement with owner should match here todo this temporary solution due figpool extending fignodemodelelement when fact should not 
SATD	 translate the visibility flag fig the pgml visibility attribute value the pgml values are hidden and shown not specified then the default return null for this prevent redundent data being written pgml todo remove gef release after will provided there param the fig return hidden nullshown 
SATD	 the file persister for the uml model todo this empty what its purpose tfm author bob tarling 
SATD	 todo not sure need this but just safe for now 
SATD	 open zipinputstream the first file found with given extension todo remove since this duplicate zipfilepersister method when have refactored the persister subsystem param url the url the zip file param ext the required extension return the zip stream positioned the required location throws ioexception there problem opening the file 
SATD	 todo this doesnt need full profilereference since uses the reader handed the constructor doesnt make much sense make its callers init the path some name which doesnt need author luis sergio oliveira euluis 
SATD	 todo seems like overkill load the model just get the display name but thats where its stored currently tfm 
SATD	 todo this appears unused its needed the model api should enhanced provide method that does this directly 
SATD	 todo this critics embedded comments actually used anyone 
SATD	 todo all this profile loadinghandling needs move someplace model subsystem probably

SATD	 settings dialog tab panel for layout optionsp todo this class contains lot references orgargoumlumlui would probably better move there todo this class breaks too many dependency limitations and not used anywhere mvw disabled its functionality author linus tolke 
SATD	 todo could also support other flavors here image then you can drag modelelements directly into your wordprocessor inserted image 
SATD	 todo why isnt this done save 
SATD	 todo the following handling multiselection just local solution for the line color better find more general solution dont know its undoable this way thn 
SATD	 todo the following handling multiselection just local solution for the fill color better find more general solution dont know its undoable this way thn 
SATD	 todo need get the modelextent and package associated with the current diagram that can create the new element the right place 
SATD	 the dialog that allows the user any diagram the project doubleclicking itp this dialog not modal and can stay open while the user working the model even possible open multiple these dialogs although the purpose such useraction eludes mep todo this dialog should have multiple tabs named help diagram classifier statevertex etc which would allow the user other things than diagrams author mvw 
SATD	 todo bob says tabs that listen for target changes should register themselves not expect detailspane listen and pass the event otherwise these tabs always rely detailspane tabtodotarget and tabprops currently listen directly 
SATD	 todo some parts argouml have preliminary support for multiple details panels but currently only support the default south bottom panel 
SATD	 todo check that this correct 
SATD	 flag indicate are the main application being integrated another top level application such eclipse via the argoeclipse plugin todo this temporary measure until projectbrowser can refactored more appropriately tfm 
SATD	 try save the project param overwrite true then overwrite without asking param file the file save param pmw the progressmonitor updated return true successful todo separate this into swing specific class tfm deprecated bob tarling use 
SATD	 todo work progress here allow multiple details panes with different contents bob tarling 
SATD	 todo this causes cyclic depencency with actionsaveproject 
SATD	 todo this needs work that users can set the font size through gui preference window 
SATD	 loads project displaying nice progressmonitor param overwrite true the file going overwritten param file the target file todo separate this into swing specific class tfm param exit true exit argouml when done 
SATD	 todo bob says were looking focus change flag the start interaction this detect when focus gained prop panel field the assumption editing that field about start not good assumption need see can get rid this 
SATD	 this class represents pool swimlanes for activity diagrams this exists only act the gef style encloser other nodes the same must placed entirely within outside the boundaries this fig but cannot intersect with the boundary todo there actual model element being represented here are inheriting lot behaviour from fignodemodelelement that dont want require split fignodemodelelement separate the code that requires model element owner see issue remark mvw why not give owner instead the activitygraph the obvious candidate maybe the top state author mkl 
SATD	 manages progressmonitor dialog note users this class should use the type the interface link wherever possible maintain gui independence author todo bob says dont like the naming this class its confusing that its called window and yet not window lets rename once have hidden 
SATD	 loads the project file and opens all kinds error message windows doesnt work for some reason those cases preserves the old project param file the file open param showui true error message may shown the user false run commandline mode param pmw the progressmonitor updated not needed use null return true the file was successfully opened todo separate this into swing specific class tfm

SATD	 command set selected figs their minimum size despite its name really the minimum size selected here todo rename this class author markus klink 
SATD	 this fig never placed diagram only used the call renderer that pick list items look like diagram figs todo this fig does not represent model element and should not extend fignodemodelelement should split fignodemodelelement two one for base functionality for all nodes and one that truly for model elements 
SATD	 todo why this code even getting called for figgeneralization 
SATD	 class manage project related actions which need historically have been managed singletons todo its unclear whether all these actually have managed singletons but for now ive just moved them from projectbrowser tfm author tom morris 
SATD	 todo this shouldnt know the internal form type names but not sure what gefs predicatetype does fixing here tfm 
SATD	 todo move different class 
SATD	 hate this much even before start writing reinitialising global place where noone will see just feels wrong well here goes 
SATD	 kludge required gefs use hashmap the api todo this can removed they ever fix gef use maps 
SATD	 critique menu todo this dependency should inverted with the critics subsystem registering its desired shortcuts with tfm 
SATD	 genericargomenubar defines the menu bar for all operating systems which not explicitly ask for different kind menu bar such mac menus and the mnemonics menus and the menuitems are separated the emmenupropertiesem menu items are separated the the keys menuproperties have the following structure pre menu filename menu menufile mnemonics menus filename menumnemonic menufilemnemonic mnemonics menuitems fileflag for itemname menuitemmnemonic menuitemnewmnemonic pre todo add registration for new menu items deprecated bob tarling this class will moved and made private future use 
SATD	 forwards this event the tree model param element the modelelement changed todo this shouldnt public components desiring inform the explorer changes should send events 
SATD	 todo delete should available any combination model elements and diagrams todo shouldnt creating new instance here should hold the delete action some central place 
SATD	 adds the entry the mru list param filename the project todo this should listen for file save events rather than being called directly tfm 
SATD	 todo make sure this shouldnt into previous condition tml 
SATD	 todo shouldnt creating new instance here should hold the delete action some central place 
SATD	 the tree structure has changed significantly inform the associated tree model todo this shouldnt public components desiring inform the explorer changes should send events deprecated mvw use events instead 
SATD	 todo really only care about events which affect things that are visible the current perspective view this could tailored cut down event traffic tfm 
SATD	 the singleton instance todo why this singleton wouldnt better have exactly one for every explorer 
SATD	 todo rather than specifically ignore some item maybe would better specifically state what items are interest otherwise may still acting other events dont need 
SATD	 todo need factory pattern for goxxx classes that can determine they are required 
SATD	 todo can this made more restrictive care about any attributes other than name tfm 
SATD	 this carried over from previous implementation not sure why dont want contents package tfm 
SATD	 todo any namespace can contain other elements why dont allow this tfm 
SATD	 todo really should elementmodelelement but dont have type which portable for this 
SATD	 todo this method can replaced when argo drops support for java versions 
SATD	 see set the locale specific text for the critic headline the one liner that appears the todo pane and the critic description the detailed explanation that appears the todo tab the details pane mvw maybe can make part the constructor cruml fixme why override nobody uses 
SATD	 set the threshold todo should this protected param threshold the threshold compare 
SATD	 todo split into one critic for inherited problems and one for problems directly this class 
SATD	 todo need this generalization not named element 
SATD	 needed 
SATD	 find all the figs that visualise the given model element this layer null there none todo once gef includes this same method diagram then this can see 
SATD	 todo this uses last one wins algorithm for registration should warn factory being overwritten 
SATD	 gets font name doesnt exist configuration creates new entries configuration for appearance todo why create getter return the name the configured font 
SATD	 todo what this trying its never going get called tfm really dirty hack remove unwanted listeners 
SATD	 todo this shouldnt referencing the current project instead the appropriate undomanager should have already been retrieved from the correct project 
SATD	 todo should given undo manager use rather than looking for global one 
SATD	 todo replace the next deprecated call this case complicated the use parameters all other figs work differently 
SATD	 class display graphics for uml choice state diagram the circle todo this should really renamed figchoicestate its the last vestige the uml name author pepargouml 
SATD	 todo what this needed for tfm 
SATD	 the next lines fix the half issue there better way 
SATD	 return list gravity points around circle which enclosed the bounding box convenience method for use figinitialstate and figfinalstate todo this method not required all sub classes would seem sensible extend figstatevertex with figcirclevertex and only have the relevant concrete figs extend that and gain this functionality return list points 
SATD	 resize only when new concurrent region added changing the height todo probably shouldnt exist this class should listening for added concurrent regions and call this internally itself param the new height 
SATD	 todo arent our items always strings tfm 
SATD	 actually instanciate the netnode and fignode objects and set the global next mode modeplace todo should call super reduce code volume see 
SATD	 todo this logic may well worth moving into the model component provide similar grid the connectionsgrid 
SATD	 todo this class listen the model will able change live done the figs diagram 
SATD	 todo redo curbody should long curlanguagebutton 
SATD	 when change the type need create new initial value and display the panel todo select the same type that the current nothing 
SATD	 todo definitely dont want react addition and removal transitions cant more specific when register ourselves listener 
SATD	 the target model element umlx this the element that owns the expression umlx this the expression itself todo this makes behaviour different enough that separate subclasses should considered 
SATD	 field todo textarea textfield 
SATD	 todo rather than specifically ignore some item maybe would better specifically state what items are interest otherwise may still acting other events dont need 
SATD	 todo this can mess there are any better solution 
SATD	 todo use notify set true forward events model only one language and body fields should have this set true 
SATD	 todo this ordered list then you have add the right location 
SATD	 see todo this should reviewed see can improved with view towards removing some the overrriding methods used workarounds for differences between nsuml and mdr tfm 
SATD	 todo this redundant invocation 
SATD	 get all classifiers our model todo need the property panels have some reference the project they belong instead using deprecated functionality 
SATD	 todo copied from umldiagramrenderer get the fignode from the given layer that represents the given model element the fignode portion association class returned preference the figedge portion fignode found then figedge searched for and the fignode that acts its edge port returned param lay the layer containing the fig param modelelement the model element find presentation for return the fignode presentation the model element 
SATD	 todo build return parameter 
SATD	 todo and getallsubstates are duplicates tfm 
SATD	 todo how merge multiple inheritance necessary this currently copies the common ancestors multiple times 
SATD	 todo this cant depend projectbrowser alternate below 
SATD	 todo this composite association these will get deleted automatically the only thing need check for any additional elements that need deleted result 
SATD	 todo this wellformedness rule from uml can have parent generalization element that leaf selfparentforalls not sisleaf 
SATD	 check arguments against parameters for type and number todo perhaps move this critic instead tfm 
SATD	 todo add standard stereotype set open ended but predefined names include call create instantiate send 
SATD	 todo there anyway can determine this size runtime 
SATD	 todo taken from handle events attribute all this event handling should eventually moved the compartment fig for attributes 
SATD	 are getting events dont want filter them out todo can instruct the model event pump not send these the first place see defect param event the event 
SATD	 gets all root elements the uml repository including available profiles that are not part the current project degrades performance only returns user model roots and profiles gets all root models but root namespaces todo which best there any other way 
SATD	 todo currently coded this actually returns all behavioralfeatures which are owned classifiers contained the given namespace which slightly different then whats documented will not include any behavioralfeatures which are part the namespace but which dont have owner 
SATD	 todo performance consider instantiating this just once outside the for loops and clear this point instead 
SATD	 delete model element implements cascading delete make sure model still valid after element has been deletedp the actual deletion delegated delete methods the rest the factories for example method deleteclass exists corehelper delete methods deleteclass should only those extra actions that are necessary for the deletion the modelelement itself deleteclass should only take care things specific umlclassp the delete methods the uml factories should not called directly throughout the code calls should always refer this method and never call the deletexxx method xxxfactory directly the reason that possible call the deletexxx methods directly pure implementation detailp the implementation this method uses quite complicated ifthenelse tree this done provide optimal performance and full compliance the uml metamodel the last remark refers the fact that the uml model uses multiple inheritance several places this has taken into accountp todo the requirements the metamodel could probably better determined reflection the metamodel then each association that deleted element participates could reviewed make sure that meets the requirements and not deleted tfmp extensions and its children are not taken into account here they not require extra cleanup actions not the form call the remove method normal for all children mbase and not the form other behaviour want implement via this operation param elem the element deleted see 
SATD	 dont allow connections created from read only model element any other todo this should considered workaround only works because default place newly created relationships the namespace the fromelement the correct behavior the presence readonly elements really depends the type connection well the writeability both ends 
SATD	 array valid connections the combination connecting class and node classes must exist row this list considered valid lithe column the connecting element lithe column the from element type lithe column the element type the column optional not given then assumed the same the from element lithe existence column indicates that the connection valid one direction only todo this encodes not only what legal uml but also what argouml knows how create not all legal connections are included probably should split into two pieces legal uml here and supported argouml application someplace tfm see also issue most these are subtypes relationship which includes association dependency flow generalization extend and include dependency includes binding abstraction usage and permission associationrole and associationclass are associations the remaining items link transition associationend message are nonrelationship types which argouml treats connectionsedges 
SATD	 todo check for duplicates this possible 
SATD	 todo also have code registering for the names tagged value like derived 
SATD	 recursive method get all subtypes todo does this have scalability problem 
SATD	 todo bob says should not listening here for addition and removal attributes this should done 
SATD	 dont wait ourselves well deadlock todo might want throw exception here 
SATD	 todo must calculate the whole list 
SATD	 todo replace this recursive function loop like getroot 
SATD	 todo because get called each and every change event when the model state flux well often get before finish this collection the only saving grace that were called many times that the last time things should stable again and well get good set elements for the final update need better mechanism 
SATD	 updates compartment box called from updatelayout there model event effecting the and from renderingchanged all cases todo the above statement means that the entire contents the compartments are being rebuilt whenever addremove attribute operation reception detected would better have compartments listen for add and remove events and make minimum change rather than entirely rebuild remark mvw this bit exaggerated since the populate method already heavily optimized 
SATD	 todo reconfigure exception handling distinguish between errors that are possible due bad input data and those that represent unexpected processing errors 
SATD	 todo callers will need refactored work around the change the way multiplicities work tfm 
SATD	 todo some elements such generalization are longer named for transitional period well return string debug can continue but the calling code should probably fixed tfm bob says these are the comments that were same trick needed here for now 
SATD	 map which resources are readonly todo this needs managed per editingdomain 
SATD	 todo mvw would not better this code would starttexteditor not overruling mouseclicked but made this fig not editable stop from reacting keypresses anyhow this hack abusing figtext gef does not really support doubleclicking fig trigger some action 
SATD	 todo does element means all direct and indirect extending classifiers only the direct extending classifiers 
SATD	 todo this code appears designed jump the diagram containing the contents the package that was double clicked but looks like its always searching for the name main instead the package name todo but any case should delegating this work something that knows about the diagrams and they contents tfm 
SATD	 todo what the behavior this the case nested models 
SATD	 todo this returning extended elements base classes 
SATD	 todo classifier association isnt navigable this direction 
SATD	 model element has been removed from this packages namespace the fig representing that model element the same diagram this package then make sure not enclosed this package todo view the fig representing the model element should removed from the diagram yet agreed bob 
SATD	 todo seems work only with both loops check why 
SATD	 todo this needs double checked tfm 
SATD	 used pgmltee return the class name and bounds together with compartment visibility todo this not duplicate with the parent 
SATD	 this node cannot dragged and manipulated the same way other fignodes argouml actually optional child fig more precisely path item figedgemodelelement this allows the dashed edge association class connect the association edge and allows the dashed edge comment edge attach comment some other edge type gef can only attach edges nodes making this fig both node and containing child edge push the rules allow edge edge connections todo are inheriting lot functionality here that dont really require should attempt make figedgeport extend fignode author bob tarling 
SATD	 searches for stereotype just like the given stereotype all given models and their subnamespaces the given stereotype can not have its namespace set yet otherwise will returned itself todo this function should not take stereotype object parameter but name and baseclass todo currently only works for stereotypes with only one baseclass todo should only search for stereotypes owned the model object param models collection models param stereo the given stereotype return stereotype 
SATD	 finds stereotype given namespace and all those any subnamespace the given namespace returns null such stereotype found todo what stereogetname stereogetbaseclass null then you know immediately that none will found but that the correct answer currently null returned these cases todo this function should not take stereotype object parameter but name and baseclass todo currently only works for stereotypes with only one baseclass todo currently only works for stereotypes where the baseclass equal the given one inheritance does not work return the stereotype found null param the namespace param stereo the stereotype 
SATD	 creates uml model element the given type this only works for uml elements diagram contains elements another type then the responsibility the diagram manage those items and not call this method also only works for uml model elements that are represented diagrams node param elementtype the type model element build return the model element todo this needs extra parameter specify the modelextent where the new element should created 
SATD	 builds compositestate top for some statemachinep todo confusing name this method should better named param statemachine the given statemachine return mcompositestate the newly build top state see 
SATD	 todo mvw this needs rethinkingrework have the following questions why does not search for stereotype the namespace using properties and only create new stereotype will actually used why there not getstereotypestring name string baseclass edited dmst 
SATD	 todo this functionality the worn place should able call setvisible the compartment itself and then this class should react that event improvements will follow later releases hence this method should not considered stable for module developers param compartment the compartment changed param isvisible true the attribute compartment visible 
SATD	 todo this should become private and only called from constructor see 
SATD	 remove all items the group otherwise the model event listeners remain todo why does figgroup not this 
SATD	 todo uml classifierrole associationrole and associationendrole have been replaced the internal structure the collaboration 
SATD	 todo the above populate works but seems rather heavy here can see something like this needed though events wont manage this quick enough could make create the new child fig instance may also useful for return the new model element rather than the current void return bob 
SATD	 todo this neededcorrect for when all compartments are hidden 
SATD	 this tag set elements that are generated reference when importing set then the critics could ignore those objects they want todo this really belongs higher level utility class that uses the facades tagged value methods also needs updated use uml tagdefinition instead simple string 
SATD	 recognizer for nary association todo this not recognizer for some type rename isnaryassociation param handle candidate return true handle association 
SATD	 builds interface with given name param name the given name return interface todo this needs extra parameter specify the modelextent where the new element should created 
SATD	 builds default implementation for interface the interface not owned any model element default users should not forget add ownership return interface todo this needs extra parameter specify the modelextent where the new element should created 
SATD	 check labels etc have been hit apparently gef does require pathitems annotations which ours arent until that resolved 
SATD	 create empty but initialized instance uml templateparameter return initialized uml templateparameter instance todo this needs extra parameter specify the modelextent where the new element should created 
SATD	 builds default implementation for class the class not owned any model element default users should not forget add ownership return newly created class todo this needs extra parameter specify the modelextent where the new element should created 
SATD	 create empty but initialized instance uml usage return initialized uml usage instance todo this needs extra parameter specify the modelextent where the new element should created 
SATD	 create empty but initialized instance uml permission return initialized uml permission instance todo this needs extra parameter specify the modelextent where the new element should created deprecated for tfmorris renamed uml packageimport use link createpackageimport 
SATD	 create empty but initialized instance uml permission return initialized uml permission instance todo this needs extra parameter specify the modelextent where the new element should created 
SATD	 action add stereotype model element todo appears unused author bob tarling deprecated for tfmorris use link 
SATD	 returns the destination relation link the destination relation defined the modelelement that receives this relation there are more then destinations only the first returned there destination null returned examples sources include classifiers that are types associationends usecases that are bases extend and include relations and the case association the destination defined the type the second element the connections listp todo move this method generic modelhelper param relationship the relation return object 
SATD	 return the source relation link the source relation defined the modelelement that propagates this relation there are more then sources only the first returned there source null returned examples sources include classifiers that are types associationends usecases that are bases extend and include relations and source always the start from the arrow the fig the destination the endp todo move this method generic modelhelper param relationship the relation return object 
SATD	 sets the language expression todo this operation fooling the user thinking that the body the object changed instead new object created there other way mexpression can not altered once created this operation returns newly created object instead param handle the expression param language the new language return the newly created object 
SATD	 todo remove the casting soon removed 
SATD	 todo having critics actions here introduces unnecessary dependency the critics subsystem have register its desired actions using extension mechanism tfm 
SATD	 true instance allowed invisible this currently only set true figedgeport todo figedgeport should removed from the fignodemodelelement hierarchy and the need for this removed 
SATD	 todo really want this class have package scope however the reflection 
SATD	 todo there are lots and lots magic numbers used calculating positions and sizes any time you see figs being placed use these constants instead you can reliably interpret calculations you can factor them out there well add additional constants needed express other common factors tfm 
SATD	 name set the empty string yuck default fix 
SATD	 todo note copypaste code figexitpoint where this code better placed gef 
SATD	 find model element modelelements which name equal name param name the name the model element find cant null param modelelements the link collection model elements which find model element with name return the model element found null todo maybe should moved helper class that deals with model related stuff 
SATD	 todo should really set our own profile instead depending the default this depends the default profile configuration containing the type integer test properly otherwise will get created the main project defeating the purpose 
SATD	 called propertychanged when detects that stereotype has been added removed removal the fignode removes its listener that stereotype when new stereotype detected add listener todo bob says opinion shouldnt doing this here figstereotype should always listening change its owners name should always listening for add remove stereotypes its owner those classes will need pass some event the fignode the awt thread only change results change size that requires redraw pnote runs the model mdr thread param event the umlchangeevent that caused the change 
SATD	 todo want the top level package here instead the immediate parent 
SATD	 todo this creates dependency the critics subsystem need generic way for modules including our internal subsystems request addition actions the popup menu tfm 
SATD	 this template method called the argouml framework the result change model element not call this method directly yourself poverride this any subclasses order change what model elements the fignode listening result change the model pthis method guaranteed the framework running the same thread the model subsystemp todo lets refactor this some time take umlchangeevent argument param event the umlchangeevent that caused the change 
SATD	 todo generalize extension and remove critic specific code 
SATD	 todo this required why would the fig already dashed see 
SATD	 prevent underline events underline does not change todo gef should manage this after gef included 
SATD	 todo generalize extension and remove critic specific stuff 
SATD	 there shall not dependency from 
SATD	 todo use the following function have dropdown set tools actions true instead this temporary solution param buttonpanel the toolbar param actions array actions representing the tool layout 
SATD	 todo shouldnt need this reflection any more once have convinced ourselves that everything with getitemuid method implementing iitemuid 
SATD	 todo figure out when this getting thrown throw new 
SATD	 constraint this code only deals with supplier per dependency todo how support more see 
SATD	 todo the namespace created events currently the model think this wrong they should the namespace the activitygraph vecaddall 
SATD	 changes the font for all figs contained the given figgroup todo fact there design error this method for class the name italic since the class abstract then the classes features should plain font this problem can fixed implementing the updatefont method all subclasses param the figgroup change the font 
SATD	 todo the namespace enlisted events currently the model think this wrong they should the namespace the activitygraph 
SATD	 todo move this figgroup gef param scb the suppresscalcbounds set 
SATD	 update the titlelabel mvw this overrules the icon set initiallly why need this 
SATD	 todo this function attempts optimize the more generic code the parent which also works correctly this case this good idea 
SATD	 creates new checkbox menu item attached the specified action object and appends the end this menu todo this almost duplicate must find way merge param the action for the checkbox menu item added return the new checkbox menu item 
SATD	 todo dthompson mouseclickedme above consumes the mouse event internally suspect that this line might not necessary 
SATD	 enables pasting existing node into diagram author eugenio alvarez data access technologies todo why have this class well 
SATD	 the constructor todo the name parameter used for the icon and for the tooltip this makes the tooltip impossible param modeclass the next global editor mode param modeargs arguments for the new mode param name the name the command that the tooltip text 
SATD	 fix bad figs due errors earlier releases argouml can happen that there generalization without child parent todo move into xsl should not remove from the graph model while were writing have possible cause concurrent modification exception param owner 
SATD	 todo the above doesnt work reliably constructor need better way getting default fig settings for the owning project rather than using the project manager singleton tfm 
SATD	 defines the methods generate source code from the model each class providing code generation functionality must implement this recognized argouml code generator todo guiindependent mechanism pass settings the code generator needed similar what have for reverse engineering see link and link since when replaced the filegenerator interface 
SATD	 hack dont show first column where the model element object placed 
SATD	 todo doesnt matter what these get set because gef cant draw anything except pixel wide lines 
SATD	 todo workaround for gef redraw problem force all child figs into the same layer 
SATD	 this should not looking for namedelement since this not always about the name this modelelement alone 
SATD	 pdetermines the figedge currently connected the correct fignodes not the edges the correct fignodes set and the edge rerouted ptypically this used when user has amended from the property panel relationship from one model element another and the graph needs react that change peg the participant association end changed pcalls helper method layoutthistoself avoid this edge disappearing the new source and dest are the same node todo this method called far too frequently should only called when specific event received seems currently called whenever any event received from the owner return boolean whether not the update was sucessful 
SATD	 todo this class should moved package 
SATD	 todo dependency cycle between fignodemodelelement and figedgeme this needed introduce removable interface decouple 
SATD	 figmycircle figcircle with corrected connectionpoint method this methods calculates where connected edge endsp todo once are gef version this whole class can removed since was taken over gef

SATD	 todo send event instead calling explorer directly 
SATD	 sets the target the property panel the given target may either diagram modelelement the target given fig check made the fig has owning modelelement and occurs the current diagram that modelelement the target deprecated argouml version the visibility this method will change the future replaced link todo mvw think this should not deprecated param target the new target see 
SATD	 todo this needs use different method than that used the constructor wants allow the method overridden 
SATD	 todo can delegate this specialist figname class 
SATD	 todo replace magic numbers with constants 
SATD	 information about source unit and its content whether exists only memory its stored file todo making this interface instead class would allow more flexibility dealing with nonfilebased resources tfm author aslo 
SATD	 todo without the null check the following throws npe many times when called from need think about 
SATD	 todo this should managed the detailspane targetlistener tfm remove the following line 
SATD	 todo this cant depend projectbrowser needs get the current drawing area from the diagram subsystem gef 
SATD	 create the main draggable label for the association this can overridden subclasses change behaviour todo consider introducing this figedgemodelelement and using throughout all edges param owner owning uml element param settings rendering settings 
SATD	 mvw for this case had move the call setselecteditem outside the buildingmodel otherwise the combo does not update with the new selection see issue 
SATD	 mvw for this case have move the call setselecteditem outside the buildingmodel otherwise the combo does not update with the new selection the same does probably apply the cases above 
SATD	 the fig for permission which form dependency todo uml the import and access permissions have become packageimports with public visibility and nonpublic visibility respectively argouml only supports the import permission currently the friend permission has been dropped also the type hierarchy has been reorganized that packageimport not subtype dependency author markus klink 
SATD	 todo how does the pressed cancel become javalangexception 
SATD	 action trigger code generation for one more classes fact only all named classes and interfaces the active diagram are generated this delivers empty collection all selected classes interfaces and the contents selected packages are generated independent they are named not todo implement more logical behaviour 
SATD	 todo bob says the model element not named could generate name generalization becomes class class 
SATD	 hack make sure that the right height applied when icon used 
SATD	 todo this should more extensible may only findpanelfortarget there panel why not show 
SATD	 utility function localize the given string with help text and show the status bar the argouml window this function used favour the inline call enable later improvements would possible show helpballoon todo this code also present other root figs param the given string localized and shown

SATD	 todo improve extensibility this 
SATD	 todo make the magic numbers configurable 
SATD	 helper method for changeconnectednode todo this should probably superclass associations can several diagram types 
SATD	 returns the current target deprecated argouml version the visibility this method will change the future replaced link todo mvw think this should not deprecated return the target see 
SATD	 reroutes the connection the old node connected the new node delegates reroutexxx for each the possible edges class diagram association dependency generalization link todo this should probably superclass many figs can several diagram types param newnode this the new node that one the ends dragged param oldnode this the existing node that already connected param edge this the edge that being draggedrerouted param issource tells which end being rerouted 
SATD	 prevent bold events bold does not change todo gef should manage this after gef included 
SATD	 see todo from combobox javadoc this method public implementation side effect not call override should find some other way implement this 
SATD	 todo this shouldnt know about the specific type fig that being displayed that couples too strongly things shouldnt need know about tfm 
SATD	 the model for the table with the tagged values implementation for uml and tagdefinitions todo this currently only supports taggedvalues with tagdefinition which has type string 
SATD	 todo use our extension registration mechanism for our internal classes well everything treated the same 
SATD	 todo should really passing the default settings the diagram factory they get set creation time 
SATD	 idem for generalization with leafroot object todo but showing the message the statusbar would help todo should not used for events expect happen need different way catching wellformedness rules 
SATD	 the connect method specifying connection type class unavailable the argouml implementation todo this should unsupported use the object version inheritdoc 
SATD	 todo wed like these not filled but gef wont let select them that setfilledfalse 
SATD	 gef methods todo these should really picked automatically from some gef interface that extend but there such thing note weve only added methods used argouml its possible that external consumers need other methods 
SATD	 abstract class that the parent all actions adding diagrams argouml the children this class should implement creatediagram any specific actions for creating diagram and isvalidnamespace that checks some namespace valid add the diagram argouml shall never create diagram for readonly modelelementp todo this class should merged with actionnewdiagram author 
SATD	 todo mvw not completely sure the followingp the namespace the diagram used when creating new elements that are shown the diagram they will have their namespace set according this not necessarily equal the owner return the namespace for the diagram 
SATD	 todo use default value appropriate type here 
SATD	 set the fig style according attributes todo this never used can remove param fig the fig style param attributemap map name value pairs 
SATD	 hang our heads shame there are still bugs argouml andor gef that cause corruptions the model before save takes place repair the model order certain possible that the saved file will reload todo split into small inner classes for each fix return text that explains what repaired 
SATD	 todo the reference the method was here but the class does exist anymore where this method never used param propertyname the name the property return message null not applicable 
SATD	 execute this action from the command line todo the underlying gef library relies acme that doesnt allow create these files unless there window showing for this reason have had split the performing commands link that can not supplying the batch option run these commands with the window showing hopefully this can eventually fixed see param argument the file name that save return true 
SATD	 todo make the explorer listen project member property changes eliminate coupling gui 
SATD	 todo associationclasses fit both the next cases 
SATD	 needed 
SATD	 todo can probably use this instead all the above legacy uml code tfm 
SATD	 todo fonts shouldnt handled any differently than other rendering attributes 
SATD	 todo one should sending the deprecated event from outside argouml but keep responding for now just case 
SATD	 forwards this event the tree model param element the modelelement added todo this shouldnt public components desiring inform the explorer changes should send events 
SATD	 todo this should not need know about projectsettings tfm 
SATD	 todo why cant use here bob 
SATD	 todo wed like test this its new guise packageimport but dont have good way currently 
SATD	 constraint this code only deals with supplier per dependency todo need more see 
SATD	 abstract action trigger creation new diagram argouml shall never create diagram for readonly modelelement todo bobs says can merge actionadddiagram with this class author michiel 
SATD	 first all lets set the duplicate hash this hash contains all the duplicate key for another key todo every duplicateput done twice but how avoid this 
SATD	 todo this should get the containing project from the list targets not from some global 
SATD	 todo bob says this really nasty horrible hack shadowfig should not extend fignodemodelelement instead require base class fignode with common behaviour all nodes argouml shadowfig should extend that and fignodemodelelement should extend that same base class adding common functionality for fignode that represent model element see 
SATD	 window that displays exception the user cant handle any other way todo this has been partly converted generic error dialog rather than something specific exceptions this should renamed when that process complete 
SATD	 todo dont use hardcoded colors here tfm 
SATD	 author since jan todo for uml this needs changed just toggle which represents readonly frozen not changeable 
SATD	 save the project param file the file save param pmw the progressmonitor updated return true successful todo separate this into swing specific class tfm 
SATD	 work progress here allow multiple details panes with different contents bob tarling 
SATD	 todo the following mdr specific need something generic all model subsystems tfm 
SATD	 this the main class for the gui subsystemp users the gui subsystem components that are place themselves any the gui components register themselves this classp todo add the rest the registers this author linus tolke since 
SATD	 the constructorp todo this constructor used what the purpose with param the name localized param subs the rules 
SATD	 todo shouldnt need this reflection any more once have convinced ourselves that everything with setitemuid method implementing iitemuid 
SATD	 todo support nested let expressions 
SATD	 this needed for commentedge todo why doesnt commentedge implement iitemuid and handled with the mechanism above 
SATD	 sets the directory name where the profiles can found initially uml used todo intermediate solution for uml support please implement better solution param dir name the directory for the profiles 
SATD	 todo this the wrong place its not profile specific needs moved main xmi reading code tfm 
SATD	 this can made public allow others extend their own persisters 
SATD	 once all edges are connected compute route each make sure that annotations and the edge port positioned correctly only this after all edges are connected compute route requires all edges connected nodes todo would nice not have this and restore annotation positions instead 
SATD	 param project the argouml link project save file param file the link file which argouml link project will persisted return the persister used and usable for file throws saveexception saving the file goes wrong throws interrupt occurs while saving todo move this helper class 
SATD	 todo this whole class needs updated remove use deprecated methods and hopefully test multiroot and multiproject methods since nov author 
SATD	 method assign data immediately see end file todo ever want extend pathitemplacement should modify this that also recognise any subclass pathitemplacement the class name pathitemplacment todo use class reference make this dependency obvious 
SATD	 todo there are cyclic dependencies between and fignodemodelelement register these actions opaquely since dont what they are tfm 
SATD	 todo care

SATD	 this class manages the projects loaded argouml and what the current project classes argouml can ask this class for the current project and set the current project since only have one project argouml the moment this class does not manage list projects like one would expect this could nice extension for the future argouml soon the current project changed property changed event fired todo move everything related the creation project into the projectfactory since nov author stereotype singleton 
SATD	 todo this used places other than diagrams needs stay projectsettings well being diagramsetting return returns codetruecode show stereotypes the explorer 
SATD	 throws saxexception when things wrong with sax throws ioexception when theres error throws when the parser finds wrong syntax todo unused 
SATD	 since this hopefully temporary solution and nobody ever looks the type notation event can simplify from sending every existing event one event only but since there catchall event defined just make one rationale reduce the number total refreshes the drawing 
SATD	 prefix identified implementation specific class todo this should generalized doesnt have changed each time new implementation created tfm 
SATD	 todo this temporary need new list for uml the following uml elements are not uml 
SATD	 todo this currently just mechanical merge the tests from the generic model test and the nsuml tests they need reviewed merged author euluis since version

SATD	 todo projectbrowser doesnt need mediate this conversation use event listener the todopane communicate instead tfm 
SATD	 the project interface encapsulates all information about designers project contains the list diagrams and uml models various project properties such the authors name and defaults for various settings todo this interface was mechanically refactored from the implementation class link projectimpl needs reviewed and cleaned eliminating methods which should part the public api and splitting the interface into smaller function specific trashcan interfaces author tom morris tfmorrisgmailcom thomas neustupny since when replaced the concrete class the same name 
SATD	 todo this should listen for new target events fired that can decouple from the projectbrowser 
SATD	 todo should fire its own event and projectbrowser todo should register listener 
SATD	 agency manages critics since classes are not really first class objects java singleton instance agency made and passed around needed the agency keeps registry all critics that should applied each type design material when design material instance critiqued asks agency apply all registered critics the current scheme there thread that proactively continuously critiques the design hand even the user idle this simple and works the disadvantage that all active critics related given design material are applied regardless the reason for the critiquing and lot cpu time basically wasted todo moving toward more reactionary scheme which specific design manipulations the editor cause critics relevant those manipulations applied this transition still half done triggers are the critiquing requests the code for triggers currently dormant latentp todo there strong dependency cycle between agency and designer they either need merged into single class partitioned differently perhaps using interface break the cycle the designer singleton gets passed almost every single part the critic subsystem creating strong coupling throughout tfm author jason robbins 
SATD	 reply true iff this critic relevant the goals that the designer trying achieve default all critics are relevant regardless the goalmodel really this something for controlmech compute but subclass critic encapsulates some information you may need override this method todo would like better default action but goals are typed and their values must interpreted critics they are not generic the decisionmodel param dsgr the designer return true relevant 
SATD	 todo this hack much better way doing this would not start the critic the first place 
SATD	 return true iff the given todoitem still valid and should kept the given designers todolist critics that are not enabled should always return false that their todoitems will removed subclasses critic that supply multiple offenders should always override this method default this method basically asks the critic again critique the offending object and then checks the resulting todoitem the same the one already posted this simple and works fine for lightweight critics critics that expend lot computational effort making feedback that can easily check see still holds should override this method todo maybe todoitem should carry some data make this method more efficient inheritdoc 
SATD	 the decisionmodel part the state the designer describes what types decisions design issues the designer thinking about the current time critics that are relevant those decisions are made active critics that are not relevant are made inactive todo there some notion that each decision has certain importanance certain time but have not followed through that because dont have good examples how quantify the importance decision todo right now the individual decisions are just strings maybe they should have some nonatomic structure author jason robbins 
SATD	 how much control should critics have over when they are relavant does doing that code instead declaratively limit reasoning how does using more semantically rich method calls impact componentization 
SATD	 this class models the designer who building complex design some application domain and needs continuous feedback aid the making good design decisionsp strongthis area needs work especially central idea argostrongp currently almost everything hardcoded what can configurablep the todolist dependent this class each designer has its todolistp each designer has his own agency which the only class that knows all the criticsp this class listens property changes from designer can create todo items just like the critics hence the designer implements the poster interfacep todo there strong dependency cycle between agency and designer they either need merged into single class partitioned differently perhaps using interface break the cycle the designer singleton gets passed almost every single part the critic subsystem creating strong coupling throughout tfm author jason robbins

SATD	 brooms all the message which coordinate upper than the position the broom todo provide modefactory and then this class can become package scope author penyaskito 
SATD	 this temporary hack until the notation provider for message will able parse successfully when the sequence number missing remove this method completely then 
SATD	 todo calcbounds called selectionmanager when the fig dragged this code needed reposition any self message they are become detached from their classifier role see issue the cause the detachment not yet understood unfortunately calcbounds called from several other places the code here not optimal but the best workaround until argouml can provide its own replacement selectionmanager for sequence diagram requirements see 
SATD	 the default behaviour from figedgemodelelement not correct here see issue todo must determine what here but for now doing nothing better not sure why the super method would not work would expect that nothing the ends are already correct return true all times for now 
SATD	 create empty but initialized instance uml parameter return initialized uml parameter instance todo this needs extra parameter specify the modelextent where the new element should created 
SATD	 convert bounding box very screwy gef sometimes uses center and sometimes upper left todo gef also positions text the nominal baseline which well inside the bounding box and gives the overall size incorrectly 
SATD	 this the interface for registering interest events sent from the model componentp neither the registration unregistration nor the events themselves contain any reference the model implementation instead they use the link link deliver eventsp the reference the listener weakreference you dont need call you can just forget about your listener and eventually finalized and removed this also means that you will have keep reference your listener while active since the garbage collecting mechanism not really deterministic forgotten about listener might still receive events unless can handle them harmless way this approach should not used todo this still true does refer the nsuml implementation tfm this part the contract that established between the model subsystem and its users that not fulfilled the current implementation then the current implementation incorrect linus todo what event names the event names generated are link strings and their values and meanings are not really well documented general they are the name association end attribute the uml metamodelp here are some highlightsul liremove event sent when the element removed author linus tolke

SATD	 recognizer for modelelements with package visibility todo this method name was chosen for compatibility with the existing naming scheme but has the potential clashing with some future use param handle candidate return true handle has package visibility 
SATD	 recognizer for modelelements which have the singleton stereotype applied todo moved this out the facade someplace elese since its not model subsystem specific tfm param handle candidate return true handle singleton 
SATD	 this should moved action 
SATD	 return the tagged value with specific tag warning this method returns only the first taggedvalue found with the given name hence this method simplification the real problem and should avoided todo what should done about the above problem options are deprecate the method throw exception the name ambiguous leave the caller figure out themselves param handle the model element the tagged value belongs param name the tag name return the found tag null not found 
SATD	 todo this removed from uml 
SATD	 todo some these magic numbers probably assume line width replace with appropriate constantsvariables 
SATD	 todo this needs managed perproject permodelextent basis 
SATD	 returns all states that can recursively contained the given state todo link and link are duplicates implemented for mdr isnt clear from the javadoc usage whether they should different things this just happened because one noticed already had another method param ostate the composite state are searching the states for return collection the collection with found states 
SATD	 add path the list paths searched when looking for xmi files resolve external references with the list maintained static structure shared all instances todo its desirable have separate search paths for separate files but more work required argouml that knows how maintain separate contexts for the profiles and user models param path directory path add the search path 
SATD	 the buttons selection for stereotype todo find way hide the the figclass the created metaclass author michiel 
SATD	 changecommand that updates its label the label this command can contain the character that will replaced with information about object when the label returned todo switch this use java string formatting instead private notation author bogdan pistol

SATD	 todo see protected need present each subclass 
SATD	 todo dont want this once have dropped uml map uml names uml equivalents 
SATD	 todo comment rueckert dont think makes much sense query interactions from collaboration uml since this diagram does longer exist and interaction means something different uml 
SATD	 todo comment rueckert arueckertgmxnet think the handle holding the collaboration implementation should rather collaborationuse uml but workaround for now ill try get collaboration representation collaborationuse and then try get the owning classifier from there 
SATD	 todo this probably cant implemented way that will make the uml happy needs generalized uml semantics 
SATD	 todo what want use equivalent here 
SATD	 todo there option can use save our argouml version 
SATD	 todo just guess probably not right tfm return handle instanceof linkenddata 
SATD	 todo this doesnt belong the implementation specific piece tfm 
SATD	 todo the uml concept multiplicity multiplicity range has been replaced single element 
SATD	 todo not sure the semantics are exact match here between uml aggregate and uml shared 
SATD	 todo changed uml special type property 
SATD	 todo tagdefinitions are gone from uml they are now properties stereotypes 
SATD	 todo moved this out the piece tfm everything primary for now not reverse engineered 
SATD	 this keeps track the editing domain that used track all changes the model todo this probably needs set editingdomain that can manage editingdomain per project 
SATD	 todo this method mostly entirely redundant tfm 
SATD	 todo the javadoc specifies that null should returned from are null there are associations between them should return empty collection instead and the javadoc should changed 
SATD	 todo this isnt right 
SATD	 todo does element means all parents direct and indirect only the direct parents 
SATD	 todo what the purpose this why hide buttons here presumably should not assume selectionclass 
SATD	 todo currently delete the old values before setting something new this workaround issue should consider giving api get the lower and upper values that controls can listen directly those rather than the element containing those values 
SATD	 todo umlx event has parameters the event metaclass umlx corresponds the trigger metaclass umlx see uml superstructure page 
SATD	 todo this should built reflection from the metamodel tfm update for uml metamodel not replaced reflection 
SATD	 dont implement deprecated method interface 
SATD	 todo booleanexpresion removed from umlx use valuespecification 
SATD	 todo this will need adapted send undoredo commands back our consumer argouml new undo mechanism implemented for the model subsystem tfm 
SATD	 this sets the editing domain for the model editor todo probably need editingdomain per argo project that can keep the resourcesets separate 
SATD	 todo model implementation independent 
SATD	 todo mvw really look into supertypes the stereotype should looking into supertypes the baseclass 
SATD	 todo really want stereotypes from nested packages

SATD	 array valid connections the combination connecting class and node classes must exist row this list considered valid lithe column the connecting element lithe column the from element type lithe column the element type lithe column optional not given then assumed the same the element lithe existence column indicates that the connection valid one direction only todo this encodes not only what legal uml but also what argouml knows how create not all legal connections are included probably should split into two pieces legal uml here and supported argouml application someplace tfm most these are subtypes relationship which includes association dependency flow generalization extend and include dependency includes binding abstraction usage and permission associationrole and associationclass are associations the remaining items link transition associationend message are nonrelationship types which argouml treats connectionsedges 
SATD	 todo can get this info from uml plugin perhaps collect all references the metamodel filter for those which represent containments and find the types either end tfm 
SATD	 todo use for transition 
SATD	 todo shouldnt actually have all this work 
SATD	 todo hook this creating new resource someplace more more appropriate perhaps createmodel better yet add new method model api create new top level projectmodelxmi file dont depend side effects 
SATD	 todo check for resource hold this and create necessary this discrepancy between mdr which does here and euml which does part setrootmodel 
SATD	 todo getsetrootmodel arent specific the model implementation they could probably moved elsewhere tfm 
SATD	 think that the synchronized access idtoobjectmaps required order respect the thread safe nature the object fixme maybe this should moved into because depends internal implementation details 
SATD	 todo can choose between something which matches uml name something that matches functionality weve chosen functionality for now but this will create name conflict during the migration process tfm 
SATD	 todo change throw exception when uses are fixed throw new nonnls 
SATD	 near clone this code works fine outside argouml but throws null pointer exception during the transform when run within argouml think its something with the class libraries being used but cant figure out what ive done simpler less efficient stepwise translation below serialtransform 
SATD	 todo bob says coding use side effect here maybe this should done clearer way but fixes seems that when loading xmi that not contained zip file then the inputstream given the argument this method cant reused the end the stream that case systemid appears nonenull this stage systemid not null recreate the inputsource 
SATD	 create temporary file for output todo should able chain this directly xmi reader 
SATD	 xmiwriter implementation for mdr this implementation clumsy because the specified writer interface wants characters while the xmiwriter wants outputstream dealing bytes could easily create writer from outputstream but the reverse not true todo the old writer based interface can removed when the deprecated removed author lmaitre 
SATD	 todo return empty collection null input throw illegalargument 
SATD	 todo iterator filter would nice here instead the mucking around with the collection 
SATD	 todo doing this violates the minimal cardinality allow least need critic warn about 
SATD	 apply profile stereotype make profile our convention hack create that stereotype instead using the uml profile 
SATD	 systemid valid url simply use todo this causes network connection attempt for profiles 
SATD	 todo make this work when the given stereotype has more than one baseclass todo currently only works for stereotypes where the baseclass equal the given one inheritance does not work 
SATD	 todo mvw really look into supertypes the stereotype should looking into supertypes the baseclass 
SATD	 todo using just the last piece the leaves the potential for name collisions two linked files have the same name different directories 
SATD	 todo this should use minimal update strategy instead removing all and then adding all tfm 
SATD	 todo what type validation can here tagtype 
SATD	 todo this can simplified just include base 
SATD	 anything not found newly created return null systemid indicating that the parent document todo this assumption will invalid ifwhen allow editing linked submodels 
SATD	 todo distinguish between deferred resolution and things which are unresolved end load and should reported user 
SATD	 todo this assumes ranges are sorted this true tfm 
SATD	 todo this adequate for finding profiles java webstart jars tfm 
SATD	 todo check whether this really needed think its left over from incomplete understanding the magicdraw composition error problem tfm 
SATD	 todo not sure whether the above better some cases but the code below better for both java web start and eclipse 
SATD	 todo this returns collection not single object this what the callers expect 
SATD	 todo this code manually processes the elementimports package but need check whether mdr already does something similar automatically part its namespace processing tfm 
SATD	 todo this has different semantics than everything else 
SATD	 todo this does not belong here use getimportedelement 
SATD	 todo rationalize this with 
SATD	 todo temporary stopgap for enumerationliteral 
SATD	 todo more required here support referencevalues 
SATD	 todo what other nonmodelelement types need handle here 
SATD	 this causes problems can make multiple return messages refer the same activator even not returning the same classifier role the activator emenates from not sure that changing the activator one message should amend any other messages but this certainly changing too many bob 
SATD	 todo this needs localized but dont have any localization capabilities the model subsystem object args typename elemname alias imported alias return translatorlocalize args 
SATD	 register listener for metamodel class and all its subclasses optionally qualified list property names todo verify that propertyevent names are legal for this class the metamodel 
SATD	 todo want construct artificial name here 
SATD	 todo implement support for types other than string 
SATD	 todo this should done after all events are delivered but leave here for now avoid last minute synchronization problems 
SATD	 only verification debug level logging todo should leave this always tfm 
SATD	 todo mvw this needs rethinkingrework have the following questions why does not search for stereotype the namespace using properties and only create new stereotype will actually used why there not getstereotypestring name string baseclass edited dmst these comments imported from nsuml implementation tfm see javalangobject javalangobject 
SATD	 todo the type the model element used type parameter the formal needs match the actual parameter that gets replaced with later this code going restrict that always being parameter which doesnt seem right but dont have time debug right now tfm 
SATD	 todo this should built reflection from the metamodel tfm update for uml metamodel not replaced reflection 
SATD	 todo this should use minimal update strategy instead removing everything and adding again tfm 
SATD	 todo this actually returns permissions with stereotypes both access and import when the spec calls for only the former but that seems give different semantics the way package imports work review see which wrong 
SATD	 todo want friend stereotypes too permission 
SATD	 todo have multiple string representations for multiplicities these should consolidated this form used orgargoumlumlreveng 
SATD	 get elementresidences todo unused should added facade tfm param handle modelelement return collection the elementresidence for this model element 
SATD	 todo this ambiguous whether should adding container resident 
SATD	 todo this should either extended support all aggreationkinds should simplifiedremoved from the api tfm 
SATD	 todo doesnt really make sense that namespace would returned part its own contents but thats the historical behavior 
SATD	 todo perhaps use hashset other collection with faster lookup performance case our callers are doing naive contains lookups 
SATD	 todo try reusing the same set every recursion 
SATD	 check that the two elements arent already linked the opposite way todo this part implementation wellformedness rule uml circular inheritance not allowed not 
SATD	 todo this part implementation wellformedness rule uml circular inheritance not allowed not 
SATD	 todo this not according the contract for this function but used several places and mvw presume that need this generally this part about drawing import permission between packages the part below about 
SATD	 todo should handle access and import 
SATD	 todo delete instances which have this their classifier should leave them since they contain much state that the user would have recreate todo delete objectflowstates which have this their type todo delete classifierinstates which have this their type 
SATD	 todo this should probably throw exception gets invalid arguments rather than just returning null 
SATD	 todo delete old multiplicity why copy using hard coded value tfm 
SATD	 todo currently implemented this expects list multiplicityranges this interface change from the nsuml implementation suspect used accept list integers tfm see 
SATD	 todo copied from umldiagramrenderer find the figs the given layer that should the source and destination and attach these either end the figedge param layer the layer look for the fignodes param newedge the edge attach 
SATD	 todo this probably not the right location for switching off the filternewlines the setting gets lost after selecting different modelelement the diagram btw see how used see issue 
SATD	 todo this can mess there are any better solution 
SATD	 the list operations shall contain all operations all classifiers contained the same package the callaction itself todo fact also should include operations imported clasifiers see 
SATD	 see documentevent todo are the methods uses 
SATD	 creates new field that selects the language for expression param expression model should shared between language and body fields param only one language and body fields should forward events model todo mvw not understand that 
SATD	 todo why need this well control why instantiated when its not always needed 
SATD	 the constructor param expressionmodel expression model should shared between language and body fields param notify set true forward events model only one language and body fields should have this set true todo mvw not understand that 
SATD	 simplify implementation list all associations found with any the classifiers represented the linked instances todo make foolproof algorithm that only allows selecting associations that create correct model also take into account nary associations and associationclasses this algo best goes the model subsystem method see 
SATD	 todo try use 
SATD	 todo use other checkbox defines argo and extends jcheckbox 
SATD	 todo consider conditional feature the xml panel def for this 
SATD	 todo really used see 
SATD	 todo bob says the reflective code following should replaced with something more specific like this commented out code this would mean need stype changed meta type object rather than string 
SATD	 todo are the methods uses 
SATD	 opaqueexpression can have body language when display user only show one body button enabled for edit other todo can import xmi have languagebody author laurent braud 
SATD	 todo have some quirk that the baseclass addition removal from steroetype comes back rather than this needs further investigation see this can made consistent 
SATD	 todo this needs work also need listen additionremoval states tofrom classifierinstate 
SATD	 todo may want restrict the list parameters which conform the following wfr parametertype ofstype parameterkind and parameterkind out parameterkind return and parameterkind inout and 
SATD	 todo should probably this processing imported elements automatically 
SATD	 todo part this copied from maybe need some subclass for common code 
SATD	 todo should really test the model instead for this but have api yet can just check the collection build the jlist control implements the list interface 
SATD	 todo 
SATD	 not needed 
SATD	 todo maybe should stop first find highest priority 
SATD	 todo how implement this method properly 
SATD	 todo 
SATD	 todo make this final asap 
SATD	 now know that this critic still valid what need figure out the corresponding todo item still valid the todo item replaced the name some offender has changed that affects its description the contents the list offenders has changed check that creating new todoitem and then verifying that looks exactly the same this really creates lot todo items that goes waste 
SATD	 todo what should here 
SATD	 the following debug line now the single most memory consuming line the whole argouml allocates approximately all memory allocated suggestions for solutions check there string method that can used instead use two calls for now linus just comment out logloglevelfine applying critic headline 
SATD	 todo why need this when can just change the font and achieve the same effect 
SATD	 todo this work should deferred until actually needed for display 
SATD	 todo removed from uml 
SATD	 todo should doing anything deleted elements this throws exception remove events skip for now tfm 
SATD	 todo implement 
SATD	 todo allow other configuration handlers 
SATD	 werent given system attempt use the url for the jar that were loaded from why tfm 
SATD	 todo register listener for target todo item changes and for new showstep requests 
SATD	 todo review priority public system has been reversed from original implementation 
SATD	 todo this shouldnt require two passes through the list tfm 
SATD	 compute which critics should active they can applied applyallcritics for given designer note setting global data the isenabled bit each critic based the needs one designer dont really support more than one designer which why each designer would support more than one designer has his own agency todo should loop over simpler list critics not compoundcritics param the designer 
SATD	 todo why this disabled always 
SATD	 todo should have image wizard some logo 
SATD	 todo these buttons for future enhancement 
SATD	 todo check type 
SATD	 todo for uml powertypes are accessed indirectly through the generalizationsets that contain generalization since nov author 
SATD	 unused currently stringbuffer taggedvaluessb 
SATD	 todo placeholder implementation until support for tracking perproject basis implemented return dirty 
SATD	 empty implementation 
SATD	 todo why this special case tfm 
SATD	 flag indicate are creating new current project todo this isnt threadsafe way doing mutual exclusion 
SATD	 todo indicate the direction 
SATD	 todo need way set the line color and width here but testdependencies thinks this creates dependency cycle fig line new argofiglinesnapx snapy snapx snapy argofiglinecolor 
SATD	 apparently this method never called 
SATD	 todo this code can removed when getcurrentproject removed 
SATD	 todo can just this every time need for else bob 
SATD	 todo tentative implementation want something that updates the list open projects just simple open and close events tfm 
SATD	 todo add empty placeholder here 
SATD	 todo needs completing stub implementation only tfm 
SATD	 todo needs 
SATD	 todo why arent throwing exception here returning null results npe and explanation why 
SATD	 todo expect association end here check more carefully tfm 
SATD	 todo this should only checking for the top level package anything all 
SATD	 use little trick find out where argo being loaded from todo use different resource here argoini unused and deprecated 
SATD	 todo placeholder implementation until support for tracking perproject basis implemented 
SATD	 todo performance drain load all classes startup time they should lazy loaded when needed instead scanning all classes for ones which implement our loadable module interface should use manifest entry special namename pattern that look for find the single main module class load here tfm 
SATD	 enable todo this default selects all modules that are found eventually would rather obey default either from the modules themselves from how they are found and also have information what modules are selected from the configuration 
SATD	 its jar clean and make look like file url 
SATD	 also show tagged values for uml todo what for uml here 
SATD	 todo mark diagramproject dirty 
SATD	 todo have any potential consumers the unversioned name outside the notation subsystem 
SATD	 the constructor todo why does this method not handle all settings 
SATD	 todo these defaults need checked against historical ones 
SATD	 todo shouldnt something here

SATD	 todo required 
SATD	 todo better implementation would batch events into logical groups and update the tree one time for the entire group synchronizing access the model repository that stays consistent during the query this would likely require doing the updates different thread than the event delivery thread prevent deadlocks for right now protect ourselves with trycatch blocks

SATD	 the activity diagramp todo finish the work subactivity states 
SATD	 this may not actually make any difference present the code behind addtrigger needs more work 
SATD	 todo have anything add here 
SATD	 todo may return the following when the relocate has been implemented 
SATD	 todo before adding new region make the last region its minimum size smallest size that will still contain all enclosed 
SATD	 todo really need listening for both these events 
SATD	 todo this comparison very suspect should use equals method the code within the block fact never executed hesitate change this now will trigger code has never been used before and not aware any problems that usage may introduce think that need able find different way implement the intent here which seems correct edge drawings that should actually not allowed bob 
SATD	 todo after removing region reset the overall size the node 
SATD	 associations not supported yet todo create appropriate classdiagramedge 
SATD	 todo make another pass deal with overlaps 
SATD	 todo may return something useful when the relocate has been implemented like all statemachines that are not activitygraphs

SATD	 todo enable models and subsystems change this flag work started markus believe where does this stand bob 
SATD	 todo todoitem stuff should made opaque extension 
SATD	 todo for uml this isstatic 
SATD	 todo why need this 
SATD	 todo this needs modified for uml 
SATD	 for backward compatibility everything above and right todo polar domain 
SATD	 todo would better here continue the loop and try build the rest the compartment hence trycatch should internal the loop 
SATD	 todo why are these different colors tfm 
SATD	 todo how handle changes shadowsize from the project properties 
SATD	 todo add unnamed new something localized course 
SATD	 todo should require graphmodel the constructor since our implementations setnamespace are going try and set the namespace the graphmodel well 
SATD	 perhaps something like the following would work instead rectangle drawingarea 
SATD	 todo this must happen the awt thread 
SATD	 todo need better algorithm 
SATD	 todo use this event mechanism update the checkmark the presentation tab 
SATD	 todo this turns out performance bottleneck can probably optimize the common case caching our iterator and current position assuming that the next request will for greater index 
SATD	 assert todo really always need this only notationprovider null 
SATD	 lets test which situation have possibilities the nodes are already the diagram can use canaddedge for this one the nodes already the diagram the other has added both the nodes are not yet the diagram for the time being will only implement situation todo implement situation and 
SATD	 todo more strongly typed data structure could used here 
SATD	 perform rerouting srcdest nodes have changed pthis method needs armed previous mousedragged avoid the situation where the user just clicks the node then clicks some unrelated fig without moving the edge ptodo improve the fig finding algorithm find the top most fig the layer will useful for nested states statechart see 
SATD	 window that shows the progress bar and cancel button convenience callers which may executing thread other than the swing event thread all methods use make sure that swing calls happen the appropriate thread todo react the close button the cancel button was pressed 
SATD	 write todo check sections are not used within the file and put them comments the end the file hint use second map compare with the used keys param filename the file name param indent the current indentation param outputlostsections true lost sections are written 
SATD	 todo uml what here 
SATD	 todo implement this show some documentation 
SATD	 todo these have been used for most instances new figfoox but additional work required extract the constant from calculations etc 
SATD	 todo work here 
SATD	 todo what does the output directory have with the class path project 
SATD	 todo this next line prevent loading usecase with stereotype grow why 
SATD	 utility function localize the given string with help text and show the status bar the argouml window this function used favour the inline call enable later improvements would possible show helpballoon todo work this out one matter possibly improve show multiple lines param the given string localized and shown 
SATD	 compilecheckbox new jcheckbox todo implement the compile feature for now disable the checkbox borderlayoutsouth 
SATD	 save the source language the model todo support multiple languages now that have uml tagged values param node param language 
SATD	 todo this transformation java specific need more languagenotation scheme for specifying qualified names possible algorithm replace all punctuation with our internal separator replace multiple separators with single instance for languages like what about tfm 
SATD	 todo need add filechooser 
SATD	 todo this needs improved even for nongui calling the config panel needs initialized 
SATD	 todo implement additional operations 
SATD	 return the fully qualified name model element java dot separated format todo really need language independent format here perhaps the list names that form the hierarchy tfm 
SATD	 todo need uml equivalent 
SATD	 the list with objects that should shown the combobox todo using list here forces linear search when were trying add new element the model which can very slow for large models 
SATD	 generates new unique and returns string the contents the string supposed unique with respect all strings generated other instances this class todo should consider using javautiluuid for this instead return string with unique content 
SATD	 todo 
SATD	 todo add updown buttons control the ordering items 
SATD	 todo add all top level packages 
SATD	 the property that this comboboxmodel depicts changed the uml model this method will make sure that the changes will done the comboboxmodel equally todo this function not yet completely written inheritdoc see 
SATD	 todo support other kinds tail 
SATD	 todo this the right range here 
SATD	 how handle empty target lists probably the wizstep should only show empty pane that case 
SATD	 this class provides text field that can used display the text all comments associated with annotated modelelement todo this could use more work currently returns all commentname commentbody attributes concatenated together into single readonly document since nov author tom morris tfmorrisgmailcom 
SATD	 todo should assert this never happens before removing panels should control their own listeners 
SATD	 todo implement this 
SATD	 todo this updating model per character basis well event listeners every character very wasteful tfm 
SATD	 todo the project should bound the action when created 
SATD	 todo would better defer this initialization until the panel actually needs displayed perhaps optimistically always return true and figure out later weve got something display tfm 
SATD	 this panel contains radio buttons that represent the changeability asssociationend author since jan todo for uml this needs changed just readonly frozen not changeable 
SATD	 todo what with the return value 
SATD	 todo property name will need updated for uml unfortunately can specify two property names here 
SATD	 todo want fire targetremoved here enough just stop updating the targets 
SATD	 todo expression and instancevalue how anyone have example 
SATD	 not implemented yet 
SATD	 mock the facade the modeleventpump the factories and helpers are all created mock objects using easymock for each them there should also possibility access their link mockcontrol object todo create the rest the getters for the control objects author linus tolke 
SATD	 todo what shall with the exception 
SATD	 todo with new reference resolving scheme the model subsystem will cache the systemid the profile open and resolve the profile its own thus the javautillist will found and the return value will present again 
SATD	 todo suspect this isnt needed call isnt needed but dont remove till out alphabeta stage 
SATD	 the uml model elements test todo this needs updated with version for uml 
SATD	 todo need this this the same emptyfiggetheight 
SATD	 todo use reflection against the test case ensure that does not import nonargouml classes 
SATD	 todo what can with other kind actions 
SATD	 todo maybe return message already exists check first and and the first found has activator then set this call message the activator and skip the code below 
SATD	 todo why need remove then add the fig 
SATD	 todo minimum height should not calculated every time but only when figmessage has been added removed currently doing that doesnt work because unknown problem how test create only two crs and create message between them then move the create message the bottom until that fixed the workaround call updateminimumheight every time the minimum size needed 
SATD	 todo implement 
SATD	 finds the operation which callevent refers based the given transition this function determines the context the statemachine that contains the given transition the context classifier then all operations this classifier are candidates the context behavioralfeature then all operations the owner classifier are candidates the first operation which the name matches the result for activity diagrams the context package then all operations all classifiers the package are candidates todo this function works for the most normal cases but needs some testing for rare cases internal transitions todo the parameters the candidates are ignored maybe this method should return set matching operations author mvw param trans object type transition param opname the name the operation sought return object the operation with the given name null 
SATD	 get the innermost containing model modelelement containing model can found the outermost containing modelelement returned which could the original element itself has owner this method intended return the innermost containing model but there are circumstances where one may really expect the outermost containing model root package returned where its being used test two elements are from disjoint namespace hierarchies hence there are two separate methods with different semantics the method link getrootobject returns the outermost containing object todo note also that some code uses navigate down from the top instead from the bottom need use consistent algorithm for this tfm param handle the model element return model for the model element 
SATD	 theres more handled which still need implemented 
SATD	 builds actor the same namespace the given actor the object not and actor nothing builtp todo this shouldnt just silently fail passed bad argument this contract will change tfm param model the namespace param actor the given actor return actor the newly built actor 
SATD	 listtransition result new arraylisttransition todo not complete how retrieve the transitions

SATD	 todo deprecate since getpluginclass longer called 
SATD	 ensure that this race condition thread safe doesnt matter who wins the race 
SATD	 todo this assumes only get set notification which isnt good assumption 
SATD	 dms handle this well 
SATD	 tbd can come with better algorithm for choosing the default label feature 
SATD	 dms should let this exception out 
SATD	 dms what eclipse running but invalid facade has been specified still should format code use encoding 
SATD	 dms better job with specific exceptions just use chained runtimeexceptions 
SATD	 the delegate uri can handled file well hope that renaming will really efficient 
SATD	 dms why not this new 
SATD	 assume that its attribute for now willcould become reference the type resolves eclass 
SATD	 nothing for now and avoid propagating the exception how should builders handle cancel 
SATD	 this fallback however this should never called 
SATD	 todo fix the space above 
SATD	 todo remove this bogus empty line 
SATD	 todo handle class cast exception better 
SATD	 dont know should run this deferred because might have give the editor chance process the viewer update events and hence update the views first 
SATD	 this big festering hack make the images the right size from the start 
SATD	 eatm demand create metadata needs depend processing mode 
SATD	 todo this really quite attrocious since there code that will assume iterator that returns strings 
SATD	 tbd return user selected subset referenced packages that contain super classes classes this package 
SATD	 call the workaround 
SATD	 tbd rethink where exactly some the following methods belong genmodel genpackage 
SATD	 there are multiple variables declaration separate this variable fragment into separate declaration 
SATD	 eatm this would wrong 
SATD	 revisit remove this code 
SATD	 the label not used 
SATD	 motif kludge would get something random instead null 
SATD	 todo what should the etype now 
SATD	 this runs the operation and shows progress appears bad thing fork this onto another thread 
SATD	 eatm kind hacky 
SATD	 this kludge deal with enumerators which crash the doswitch 
SATD	 this copied from 
SATD	 eatm this might better written single loop for the eobject case 
SATD	 second alternative should getmodelproject 
SATD	 todo hack that should removed 
SATD	 todo specialize this return resource locator for messages specific this validator ensure that you remove generated mark generated not 
SATD	 todo concerned that folders will often return even should consider something exist even though access unauthorized forbidden 
SATD	 only filescheme uris will reencoded uri was decoded the workaround above and platformresolve didnt return filescheme uri then this will return decoded uri 
SATD	 this functionality should eventually away replaced model exporters well just delegate the deprecated genpackage method the monitor isnt used wont pass 
SATD	 the eannotations and egenerictype are possible containment references well move them instead copying 
SATD	 note registry based authority being removed from new spec for uri which would obsolete rfc the spec added xml errata processing regname needs removed mrglavas 
SATD	 temporary structure hold nodes attributes namespaces scope 
SATD	 hack reading encoding 
SATD	 because the old factoring approach the create method might the case that the state the old value has changed the time get here and that case dont want duplicate the removals this code 
SATD	 revisit remove this code store port value string instead integer 
SATD	 todo this faster than many charat calls 
SATD	 revisit really need support block names unicode can just create all the names isblockname format xml schema rec 
SATD	 bubble sort why many cases thisranges has few elements 
SATD	 per schema not clear the result returned should valid uri for the future plant support iris then better not massage the initialvalue should thought consider where would the best way validate anyuri values 
SATD	 note that the way they are sorted the values indexi always increase the objects are added from right left the list eatm todo could make this more efficient grouping the adds when indices increment one that single grouped notification would result 
SATD	 todo deprecate since longer used geteditpluginclass gettestsuiteclass 
SATD	 there are multiple variables declaration separate this variable fragment into separate declaration 
SATD	 dms factor this into method use nonstatic subclass

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 barring better result this will the result 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the prefix really prefix this this has just one more empty segment the paths are the same 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this here because getextendedmetadata used during initialization and the mappings are are populated the first time its fetched which will miss the packages add initialize the tree

SATD	 use count the default this mimics the old behavior although none might better option moving forward the case callable 
SATD	 perhaps not really necessary 
SATD	 todo what else here 
SATD	 todo disable batch loading lockmode read 
SATD	 todo handle concurrent writes correctly the client should pass lock 
SATD	 turn hibernatecp into gets chance see all hibernatecp 
SATD	 note there wierd implementation the client side 
SATD	 todo this was added support initializing entitys entityentry snapshot during reattach this should refactored instead expose method assemble entityentry based this state for return 
SATD	 need drop constraints before dropping tables this dialect 
SATD	 fixme per the regionfactory class javadoc this constructor version should not necessary param props the configuration properties 
SATD	 does this dialect support check constraints 
SATD	 this called sessionfactory irregardless just disregard here could also add check sessionfactory only conditionally call start 
SATD	 does this dialect support the unique column syntax 
SATD	 this done here cos might only know the type here ugly todo improve this lot 
SATD	 does this dialect support the for update syntax 
SATD	 todo what the implication this 
SATD	 todo yuck 
SATD	 todo again how should this work for nonpojo entities 
SATD	 does this dialect support for update allowing particular rows locked 
SATD	 todo really bad evil hack fix 
SATD	 aliasrefnoderesolve false false aliasrefnodegettext todo kosher here todo kosher here 
SATD	 todo better degrade lazyfalse uninstrumented 
SATD	 does this dialect support the oraclestyle for update nowait syntax 
SATD	 icky workaround for mysql bug 
SATD	 have set the table later yuck 
SATD	 todo somehow add the newly created foreign keys the internal collection 
SATD	 this inner class implements case statementperhaps being bit overclever here 
SATD	 todo merge into one method 
SATD	 todo this bit copypaste from 
SATD	 todo what type 
SATD	 todo inefficient 
SATD	 fixme get the persistentclass 
SATD	 todo can remove this once the deprecated ctor can made private 
SATD	 todo this too conservative all preceding joins were also inner joins could use inner join here 
SATD	 todo redesign how propertyaccessors are acquired 
SATD	 todo not sure this needed 
SATD	 create index the key columns 
SATD	 todo joinkeycolumnname should called either here slightly higer level the stack get all the information need right now hbmbinder does not support the 
SATD	 todo improve this hack 
SATD	 todo bad implementation cos depends upon ordering mapping doc fixing this requires that gain access the mappings reference from configuration the filterdefinitions map directly sometime during after all the typesfilterdefs are known and before building persisters 
SATD	 use trim here ugly 
SATD	 todo ideally need the construction propertyaccessor take the following entitymode entitymodespecific data the classname for pojo entities propertyspecific data based the entitymode propertyname domjnodename the easiest way with the introduction the new runtimemetamodel classes would the the following predicates takes references both and what now termed propertyaccessor stores any values needed from those two pieces information code can then simply call with parameters likewise with 
SATD	 can happen because the multiple ways cacheremove can invoked 
SATD	 ick 
SATD	 todo this very suboptimal for some subclasses namely components since does not take advantage twophaseload 
SATD	 todo should this 
SATD	 todo suck this into initlaziness 
SATD	 temporary magic value the need for intended alleviated with future developement thus not defined environment constant used control whether should consult the jdbc metadata determine certain settings default values useful not this when the database may not available mainly tools usage 
SATD	 todo this right 
SATD	 the subquery yuck 
SATD	 use stringbuffer workaround jdk bug 
SATD	 todo copypaste from recreate 
SATD	 workaround for backward compatibility sets with notnull columns assume all columns are used the row locator sql 
SATD	 todo this eventually needs removed 
SATD	 todo remove 
SATD	 just help out during the load ugly know 
SATD	 hackworkaround sqlquery impl depend having key 
SATD	 todo handle the case foreign key something other than the 
SATD	 todo assumes all collections disassemble array 
SATD	 todo would love have this work notification basis where the successful binding entitysubclass would emit notification which the extendsqueue entries could react 
SATD	 todo really neceassry provide configuration should not enough with associated class why does entitypersisters not get access configuration the only reason could see that configuration gets passed collection persisters that they can look the domj node name the entity element case explicit node name was applied the collection element level are you kidding trivial fix then just store and expose the node name the entity persister which the collection persister looks anyway via other means 
SATD	 todo deprecated remove eventually 
SATD	 todo possibly relax that 
SATD	 todo this bit dodgy come with better way check this plus see above comment 
SATD	 use degenerated strategy for backward compatibility 
SATD	 todo this temporary that the end result will probably not take property reference perse 
SATD	 todo better handle dynamic filters through implicit see the discussion there javadocs why currently not done that way 
SATD	 get the right object from the list would easier just call getentity 
SATD	 todo should record how many properties have reffered and dont getemall throw exception way better than trial and error 
SATD	 todo this dependency kinda bad 
SATD	 todo get sql rendering out this package 
SATD	 why does this matter 
SATD	 important account for newly saved entities query todo some kind check for new status 
SATD	 todo can always use the null property approach for everything 
SATD	 does this need holdlock also return tablename with updlock rowlock holdlock 
SATD	 for sets should end the collection load after resolving the entities since might call hashcode the elements todo could this polymorphically and have two different operations implemented differently for arrays 
SATD	 todo remove this and just have subclasses use directly 
SATD	 sqlserver least needed this dropped after use strange 
SATD	 necessary register exact since can only appear where clause 
SATD	 for arrays should end the collection load before resolving the entities since the actual array instances are not instantiated during loading todo could this polymorphically and have two different operations implemented differently for arrays 
SATD	 does this dialect support the alter table syntax 
SATD	 this next bit allow for both and for older behavior where version number did not get seeded was already set the object todo shift into unsavedvalue strategy 
SATD	 todo reenable also fix the above todo 
SATD	 orphans should not deleted during copy 
SATD	 orphans should not deleted during merge 
SATD	 todo suck this logic into the collection 
SATD	 todo can actually just determine this from the incoming entityentrys 
SATD	 todo this bit actually has called after all cascades but since identity insert called synchronously instead asynchronously other actions isnt 
SATD	 this class has proxies shortcut 
SATD	 todo should this watch out for performance 
SATD	 todo need map the prob proper key right 
SATD	 todo better pass the argument 
SATD	 even really need this the update will fail anyway 
SATD	 todo would better refresh from 
SATD	 this form used from annotations essentially the same the above using resultsetmapping reference but without cachemode readonly and comment fixme annotations not use can remove from pov deprecated param query the sql query string param resultsetref the resultsetmapping name param queryspaces any specified query spaces used for autoflushing param cacheable whether the query results are cacheable param cacheregion cacheable the region into which store the results param timeout jdbclevel timeout applied param fetchsize jdbclevel fetchsize applied param flushmode the flush mode use for this query param parametertypes parameter type map param callable does the query string represent callable object proc 
SATD	 todo ugly here 
SATD	 todo not quite sure about the full implications this 
SATD	 this only works because collection entries are kept sequenced map persistence context maybe should like entities and keep separate sequences set todo calling entryset identitymap slow 
SATD	 todo much rather have this done from 
SATD	 todo hack note here cleanup the load context when have more local lce entries this works for the time being because really only the collection load contexts are implemented long term this cleanup should become part the close result set processing from the sandboxjdbc jdbccontainer code 
SATD	 todo add the notion enabled filters the cachekey differentiate filtered collections from nonfiltered but cachekey currently used for both collections and entities would ideally need define two seperate ones currently this works conjuction with the check which makes sure not read from cache with enabled filters early exit 
SATD	 postload needed for ejb todo reuse the postloadevent 
SATD	 todo should check the current isolation mode explicitly 
SATD	 brand new collection todo array cant lock objects with arrays now 
SATD	 todo iteratively get transient entities and retry merge until one the following conditions not decreasing and copycachesize not increasing todo find out retrying can add entities copycache dont think can for now just retry once throw there are still any transient entities 
SATD	 null brand new collection this will also inefficiently handle arrays which have snapshot cant any better 
SATD	 todo perhaps should additionally require that the incoming entity version equivalent the defined unsavedvalue 
SATD	 provides query splitting methods which were originally querytranslator todo this will need refactored some point author josh 
SATD	 todo most below was taken verbatim from dotnode should either delegate this logic supertype 
SATD	 todo currently expects that the individual with expressions apply the same sql table join this may not the case for joinedsubclass where the property values might coming from different tables the joined hierarchy some point should expand this support that capability however that has some difficulties the biggest how handle ors when the individual comparisons are linked different sql joins here would need track each comparison individually along with the join alias which applies and then pass that information back the fromelement can pass along the joinsequence 
SATD	 explicit select expression render the and properties projection lists for every persister the from clause into single token node todo the only reason need this stuff now collection filters should get rid derived select clause completely 
SATD	 todo better way 
SATD	 hack alert attempt work around ghost impliedfromelements that occasionally show between the actual things being joined this consistently occurs from index nodes least against manytomany not sure there are other conditions essentially lookahead the next fromelement that actually writes something the sql 
SATD	 not possible simply reuse the versionpropertynode here causes oom errors due circularity 
SATD	 this function has template restore output apply the template and write the result out todo downcast avoid using interface yuck 
SATD	 some point the generate phase needs moved out here because single objectlevel dml might spawn multiple sql dml command executions possible just move the sql generation for dml stuff but for consistencysake probably best just move responsiblity for the generation phase completely into the delegates themselves also not sure why queryloader currently even has dependency this all does need ideally like see the walker itself given the delegates directly 
SATD	 todothis only needed during compilation can eliminate the instvar 
SATD	 todo absolutely usages this constructor form can away 
SATD	 todo this bit ugly 
SATD	 even here only properties mapped the base table are referenced the set and where clauses this could handled the basicdelegate todo decide better performancewise perform that check simply use the 
SATD	 todo remove these last two batcher longer managing connections 
SATD	 very important this class needs free any static references any cglib javassist classes otherwise users will always need both their classpaths matter which either they use another option here would remove the method and have the users through the sessionfactory get this information 
SATD	 todo really need able deal with component paths here also this difficult because the hqlsql grammar expects all those node types fromreferencenodes one potential fix here would convert the intoclause just use combo child the insertstatement and move all this logic into the insertstatement thats probably the easiest approach read least amount changes the grammar and code but just doesnt feel right then insert would contain fromclauses 
SATD	 todo optimization here would consider cascade deletes and not gen those delete statements the difficulty the ordering the tables here the cascade attributes the persisters the table info gotten here should really selfcontained class representation defining all the needed attributes then could then get array those 
SATD	 todo switch statements are always evil already had bugs because forgotten token types use polymorphism for this 
SATD	 really there are two situations where should allow the insertion into properties defined superclass unionsubclass with abstract root entity discrimsubclass handled already because the fact that alreay always returns for this call may want disallow for discrimsubclass just for consistencysake currently does not work anyway 
SATD	 implicit joins are always reuse 
SATD	 todo used exprnoparens was this needed 
SATD	 todo may also want check that the types here map exactly one columnjdbctype cant think situation where arithmetic expression between multicolumn mappings makes any sense 
SATD	 not know either type blind guess 
SATD	 todo get sql rendering out here create ast for the join expressions use the sql generator grammar generate the sql text for the index expression 
SATD	 would probably refactor have logicparser builds tree simple expressions connected and not expressionparser translates from terms like foo foobar foobarbaz sql terms like foosid foosbarid etc and which does much the same thing does now 
SATD	 shortcircuit for performance 
SATD	 not absolutely necessary but does help with aggressive release 
SATD	 try block hack around fact that currently tuplizers are not given the opportunity resolve subclass entity name this allows the assume custom interceptor the ability influence this decision were not able based the given entityname 
SATD	 todo this one the ugliest and most fragile pieces code hibernate 
SATD	 todo implement functionality this might painful here the join post processing for the subquery has already been performed meaning that for thetajoin dialects the join conditions have already been moved over the where clause simple solution here might perform join post processing once for the entire query including any subqueries one fell swoop 
SATD	 yuck 
SATD	 ignore the incoming property could not found cannot sure what here the very least the safest simply not apply any dereference toggling 
SATD	 todo make this bit nicer 
SATD	 yuck 
SATD	 todo potentially look optimizing these two arrays 
SATD	 note that parameter now unused delete 
SATD	 todo figure out better way get the from elements proper tree structure this not the destination manytomany add child the origin 
SATD	 todo this constructor form only used from constructor directly below can away 
SATD	 should reengineer this class that rather than the current hoc linear approach processing stream tokens instead build tree expressions 
SATD	 todo should this get moved persistentcontext logically persistentcontext the thing which interceptor gets attached 
SATD	 todo something much better look the type the other expression todo have andor rules complete the resolution boolean nodes 
SATD	 todo this class does too many things need different kind path expression parser for each the diffferent ways which path expressions can occur 
SATD	 todo optimize this better 
SATD	 todo should allow suffixes these 
SATD	 todo this really necessary 
SATD	 todo not sure the best way handle this the nonperformant way 
SATD	 todo there better way 
SATD	 the class now way complex 
SATD	 todo would really nice cache the spec the querydef not have recalc the hash currently not doable though because the resultsetref stuff 
SATD	 name from super query bit inelegant that shows here 
SATD	 real hacky used count the nesting parentheses 
SATD	 put has nowait semantics this really appropriate note that needs async replication never local sync 
SATD	 ugly hack for cases like multipart path expression ending elements indices 
SATD	 fixme hacky workaround jbcache 
SATD	 todo copypaste from sessionimpl pull 
SATD	 todo need find clean way handle the event source role seperate classs responsible for events just duplicates most the session methods passing around seperate reto interceptor factory actionqueue and persistentcontext not manageable 
SATD	 must done here because sideeffect yuck 
SATD	 should actually rework this class not implement parser and just process path expressions the most convenient way 
SATD	 todo should remove this exposure and have all references the sessions batcher use the connectionmanager 
SATD	 may screwed here since the collection action about execute and not know the final owner key value 
SATD	 needed the clazz check work around unionsubclasses todo there way tell whether persister truly discrimcolumn based inheritence 
SATD	 work around bug all known connection pools 
SATD	 todo reuse the preloadevent 
SATD	 need better way define the suffixes here 
SATD	 workaround for weblogic 
SATD	 todo temporary 
SATD	 todo yuck fix after hhh complete 
SATD	 would great move all this below here into another method that could also used from the new scrolling stuff would need change the way the maxrow stuff handled behind interface that could the control breaking the means know when stop 
SATD	 todo the ientityspan bit depends upon subclass implementation very bad 
SATD	 some messy complex stuff here since createcriteria can take aliased path path rooted the creating criteria instance 
SATD	 todo add criteriaimplementor interface this class depends directly upon criteriaimpl the impl package 
SATD	 polymorphism not really handled completely correctly perhapswell actually its assuming that the entity name used the lookup the same the the one used here which will 
SATD	 this not very nice and quite slow 
SATD	 todo get sql rendering out here 
SATD	 meant handle dynamic instantiation queriescopy from queryloader 
SATD	 make sure this defined parameter and check the incoming value type todo what should the actual exception type here 
SATD	 worrying about proxies perhaps little bit overkill here 
SATD	 todo throw exception maybe warn not the same 
SATD	 todo make entitypersister not depend interface possible 
SATD	 todo what amount significant digits need supported here from the decimalformat docs significant digits minimum integer digits maximum fraction digits 
SATD	 for backward compatibility allow set with notnull element columns using all columns the row locater sql todo create implicit not null constraint all cols 
SATD	 todo copypaste from manytoonetype 
SATD	 todo code duplication with 
SATD	 todo throw exception 
SATD	 should this interface extend propertymapping 
SATD	 todo here why need make bytecode provider global todo again fix this after hhh complete 
SATD	 todo currently keeps getters and setters instead propertyaccessors because the way getgetter and getsetter are implemented currently yuck 
SATD	 todo yuck this not quite good enough its quick hack around the problem having toone association that refers embedded component 
SATD	 todo implement caching proxies 
SATD	 this really necessary 
SATD	 todo this little inefficient dont need whole deep replaceelements call 
SATD	 todo this bit arbitrary expose switch the user 
SATD	 return collection removal fixme even isinversetrue 
SATD	 todo fix this will work for nonpojo entity mode 
SATD	 todo move these new joinabletype abstract class extended entitytype and 
SATD	 todo would nice handle proxy classes elegantly 
SATD	 spaces todo not sure but perhaps should exclude abstract denormalized tables 
SATD	 todo there more elegant way than downcasting 
SATD	 todo remove use instanceof 
SATD	 todo perhaps this should some other runtimeexception 
SATD	 yuck 
SATD	 todo need some caching scheme really comes down decision regarding amount state any kept propertyaccessors 
SATD	 todo design new lifecycle for proxyfactory 
SATD	 todo should really just collect these from the various selectexpressions rather than regenerating here 
SATD	 todo should this really return null not figure out something better here 
SATD	 todo should seriously consider not allowing txn begin from child session can always route the request the root session 
SATD	 should indicate that are processing insertupdatedelete query with subquery implied via collection property function here need use the table name itself the qualification alias todo verify this works for all databases todo this also the case nonindexed scenarios 
SATD	 todo this really needs delayed unitl after definitively know all node types where this currently problem parameters for which where cannot unequivocally resolve expected type 
SATD	 todo make this the factory for entity mode related sessions also means making this the target transactionsynch and the thing that knows how cascade things between related sessions that point perhaps this thing sessioncontext and connectionmanager jdbccontext sessioncontext should live the impl package 
SATD	 create index the key columns 
SATD	 this 
SATD	 init the table here instead earlier that can get quoted table name todo would better simply pass the qualified table name instead splitting into schemacatalogtable names 
SATD	 perhaps this should exception since only ever used the above method 
SATD	 note this assumes something about how implemented the subclass was before now tried remove that unqoting and missing aliases 
SATD	 put placeholder entries dont recurse back and try save the same object again question should this done before onsave called likewise should done before onupdate 
SATD	 before cascade todo should this 
SATD	 todo should throw exception really know for sure that this detached instance rather than just assuming throw new 
SATD	 todo the order which entities are saved may matter particular transient entity may need saved before other transient entities can saved keep retrying the batch transient entities until either there are transient entities left transientcopycache transient entities were saved the last batch for now just run through the transient entities and retry the merge 
SATD	 todo object was uninitialized proxy this inefficient resulting two sql selects 
SATD	 todo put this stuff back read snapshot from the secondlevel cache needs some extra work 
SATD	 this kinda the best can 
SATD	 trim done workaround stupid oracle bug that cant handle whitespaces before 
SATD	 todo this neednt exclude subclasses 
SATD	 todo use two visitors here inefficient 
SATD	 todo does this really need here does the collection already have its own uptodate snapshot 
SATD	 otherwise trimspecification andor trimcharacter have been specified need decide which options are present and the right thing should leading trimcharacters trimmed should trailing trimcharacters trimmed the trimcharacter the trimsource 
SATD	 possible that the treewalking outerjoinloader can get association defined subclass which case the propertyref might refer property defined subclass the current class this case the table name not known this temporary solution assumes that the propertyref refers property the subclass table that the association belongs reasonable guess todo fix this add propertyname 
SATD	 todo alternative check the owner has changed hasnt then return collectiongetowner 
SATD	 suppose 
SATD	 tbd should this varbinary binary 
SATD	 shortcut 
SATD	 todo should provide some way get keys collection statistics make easier retrieve from gui perspective 
SATD	 todo probably better calculate these and pass them itll more performant 
SATD	 todo should additionally check the current isolation mode explicitly 
SATD	 todo simply remove this override fix the above todos 
SATD	 todo there really any reason kkeep trying this fails once 
SATD	 todo not sure this correct could not find docs how this 
SATD	 hsql has blobclob support but just put these here for now 
SATD	 merges dont cascade uninitialized collections todo perhaps this does need cascade after all 
SATD	 yick need this for proper handling 
SATD	 todo should orphans really deleted during lock 
SATD	 todo move stringhelper 
SATD	 sets can just view part another collection need copy sure wont changing underneath thissetaddallset 
SATD	 todo would really really nice use this also model components 
SATD	 todo move sql package 
SATD	 todo look the owning property and check that isnt lazy instrumentation 
SATD	 todo add this info the translator and aggregate here 
SATD	 would better use the elementtype determine whether the old and the new are equal here the problem being not necessarily have access the element type all cases 
SATD	 todo code duplication with 
SATD	 todo refactor sql package 
SATD	 todo two hashmap lookups here one too many 
SATD	 note that this method could easily moved ever needed reuse from other subclasses 
SATD	 from the collection associations locate oja for the manytoone corresponding this persister fully define the manytomany need that oja that can use its alias here todo there better way here 
SATD	 todo this class depends directly upon criteriaimpl the impl package add criteriaimplementor interface 
SATD	 need qualify index names with the schema name 
SATD	 todo probably should have make clean 
SATD	 yukky dont you have subclasses for that todo race conditions can happen here 
SATD	 note very hackish workaround todo fix this will work for nonpojo entity mode 
SATD	 todo need make the majority this functionality into toplevel support class for custom impl support 
SATD	 for domj collections only todo would better this was done the higher level printer 
SATD	 todo inefficient that cache just going ignore the updated state 
SATD	 todo alternative check the owner has changed hasnt then get the from collectiongetowner 
SATD	 todorefactor make this method private 
SATD	 todo keep seperate notions here for shallownonshallow queries 
SATD	 todo temporary needed because currently persister the one that creates and renders the join fragments for inheritence hierarchies 
SATD	 this called sessionfactory irregardless just disregard here could also add check sessionfactory only conditionally call stop 
SATD	 swaldman modify allow null values signify fall through poolconfig defaults 
SATD	 work around that crazy issue where the tree contains empty fromelements text afaict this caused 
SATD	 kinda ugly but needed for collections with node mapping 
SATD	 todo would great have method dont believe that accounts for the identifier property returns for property named then should have nonid field named 
SATD	 entity name will not available for nonpojo entities todo cache the entity name somewhere that available this exception 
SATD	 index todo this kinda slow 
SATD	 todo move sql package and refactor with similar things 
SATD	 todo not sure about the exception handling this bit 
SATD	 ugly little workaround for fact that does not handle component properties 
SATD	 append the sql return the generated identifier todo suck into insert 
SATD	 this really ugly but necessary 
SATD	 todo modify the class definition not already transformed 
SATD	 todo should use select for update 
SATD	 create action that will evict collection and entity regions based queryspaces table names todo cache the autodetected information and pass instead 
SATD	 todo this correct 
SATD	 used only for regression testing todo obviously get rid all this junk 
SATD	 note this assumes something about how implemented the subclass was before now tried remove that unqoting and missing aliases 
SATD	 todo move into collection type can use polymorphism 
SATD	 todo should just collect these like with the collections above 
SATD	 todo should really move this log statement collectiontype where this used from 
SATD	 hum should cascade anyway throw exception fine like 
SATD	 todo this might really even moved into the cfg package and used the basis for all things which are configurable 
SATD	 todo copypaste from insertrows 
SATD	 todo suck into event class 
SATD	 todo never reached since gettypename actually throws exception 
SATD	 this used sessionfactoryimpl hand the generated sessionimpl was the only reason could see that cannot just use null 
SATD	 xmlforest requires new kind function constructor 
SATD	 todo this valid operation timestamps cache 
SATD	 todo considered validating the presence the cache here but decided defer unti case the cache never actually used 
SATD	 todo why not use the timestamp dataversion 
SATD	 todo eventually merge this with treecache and just add optional optlock support there 
SATD	 work around the feature where tree cache validating the inserted node during the next transaction idea 
SATD	 todo considered validating cache config here but decided defer unti case the cache never actually used 
SATD	 need that here rather than the save event listener let the post insert events have idfilled entity when identity used ejb 
SATD	 unhappy about this being public there better way 
SATD	 todo safe interpret mapremovekey null nondirty 
SATD	 fixme hack work around fact that calling node added rootaddchild fqn doesnt properly set the version the node 
SATD	 work around the feature where tree cache validating the inserted node during the next transaction idea 
SATD	 todo replace this with more elegant solution 
SATD	 short cut check 
SATD	 todo handle concurrent writes correctly this should return lock the client 
SATD	 this ugly here but needed because its subquery 
SATD	 todo will need reference session factory fully complete hhh 
SATD	 inheritance cycle detection paranoid check 
SATD	 todo encapsulate the protected instance variables 
SATD	 polymorphism comment above 
SATD	 add entry for this type entity can assured that all referenced entities have already been processed specify that this entity with the latest batch doing the batch number before adding the name the list faster way get accurate number 
SATD	 todo handle typedefs 
SATD	 todo get all properties not just the fetched ones 
SATD	 todo native ids 
SATD	 todo returnelem 
SATD	 todo handle propertyref 
SATD	 todo validate existing property with the chosen name secondpass 
SATD	 todo check that 
SATD	 todo restrict violation 
SATD	 todo assertion only could optimized away 
SATD	 todo lowercasing done here was done random before maybe not needed all 
SATD	 todo optimize away this lookup for entities 
SATD	 todo tolowercase was not done before only used template 
SATD	 todo arithmetic expressions multiple new foo 
SATD	 todo not visible the user 
SATD	 todo proxies 
SATD	 todo can limit stored procedures 
SATD	 todo formulas 
SATD	 todo better error message since actually support composites names are explicitly listed 
SATD	 todo use these methods above 
SATD	 todo cache the persister this shows yourkit 
SATD	 todo add referencedclass disambiguate fks the same columns pointing different tables 
SATD	 todo create loaders for component properties 
SATD	 todo still need make entitymodeaware 
SATD	 todo terrible implementation 
SATD	 todo eventually put this back once think all fixed object otheralias columnalias 
SATD	 todo dont really like this implementation would better this was handled 
SATD	 todo check key contains the owner 
SATD	 todo cache this instvar 
SATD	 todo temporary initial step towards hhh 
SATD	 todo remove this once componentmetamodel complete and merged 
SATD	 todo add owner argument 
SATD	 todo handle but such case does not exist the wild far 
SATD	 todo for some dialects would appropriate add the other select strings 
SATD	 todo unnecessary for databases with ansistyle joins 
SATD	 todo maybe call getrowselection 
SATD	 todo make this handle multiple collection roles 
SATD	 todo include the rowids 
SATD	 are still not resolved might represent constant needed add this here because the allowance nakedproprefs the grammar collides with the definition literalsconstants nondeterminism todo cleanup the grammar that processconstants always just handled from here 
SATD	 todo should return containstablealias 
SATD	 todo look perhaps caching this 
SATD	 todo avoid this for nonnew instances where mightbedirtyfalse 
SATD	 todo theoretically nonthreadsafe 
SATD	 todo look optimizing these 
SATD	 todo cache this sql 
SATD	 todo check mimer sql cannot handle the way does 
SATD	 todo are using identity columns fetch the identifier 
SATD	 todo check there actual definition elemnents when ref defined 
SATD	 tablenull association fill later todo fill the mappings for table null 
SATD	 tablenull association fill later todo fill the mappings for table null 
SATD	 todo add support for readwrite nonstrictreadwrite 
SATD	 todo return new lockts 
SATD	 todo why arent these the same 
SATD	 todo support multiple fetch groups would need clone the set lazy properties 
SATD	 todo 
SATD	 todo 
SATD	 todo always true for now but not later decide support elements the from clause 
SATD	 could move this inside wanted tolerate collection initializations during collection dirty checking

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not have worry about queued additions uninitialized collections since they can only occur for inverse collections 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 disassemble named parameters 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not wrappered yet its dirty this cant occur because now always call wrap before getting here return obj instanceof true obj type 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 again ccs did not have such concept but reasonable proximity clear the cache after transaction long the underlying cache not jta aware 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 oracle driver reports support getgeneratedkeys but they only support the version taking array the names the columns returned via its returning clause other driver seems support this overloaded version 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 again ccs did not have such concept however reasonable proximity clear the cache for nontransaction aware caches will also clear the end the transaction 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 remove all collections for the entity from the sessionlevel cache 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 invokeinterface callbackwrite 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 moved from 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 joins 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this entity and the property the identifier property then use getidentifiertype note that the propertynameequals propertypath checks whether have component key reference where the component class property name the same the entity property name the two are not equal this the case and wed need fall through using the property mapping 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 classes mentioned extends not available put queue 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 stuff that tuplizercentric 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 propgetname join 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 needed bump this dotnode because that the only thing which currently knows about the propertyref path the correct format either this recurse over the dotnodes constructing the property path just like dotnode does internally

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 unfortunately not really safe normalize this initial value like the others because would not able control this are using sequence 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 select topic syntax from where section like function order section topic see also

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 otherwise the destination node was implied the from clause and the from clause processor will automatically add the right place 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the first identifier the path referrs the class alias not the class name then this correlated subselect its correlated subselect use the existing table alias otherwise generate new one 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this uses but notice that compound paths are not valid only bare names and simple paths 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add the query spaces 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 reset the node type because the rest the system expecting fromfragment all wanted was for the factory create the right subclass this might get reset again later anyway make the sql generation simpler 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 explicit true this explict select arraylist sqlresulttypelist new arraylist 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 type generate the select expression 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the expression list has exactly one expression and the type the expression collection then this might collection function such indexc sizec 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the uberrule here that need include subclass joins the fromelement any way dereferenced property from the subclass table otherwise end with column references qualified nonexistent table reference the resulting sql 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 cascade first that all unsaved objects get their copy created before actually copy 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 copyvalues works reflection explicitly mark the entity instance dirty 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the following variables are stacks that keep information about each subexpression the list nested subexpressions are currently processing 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need even collect this information the persister considered multitable

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 retrieve the value the designated column the current row this resultset object javaioreader object 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for arrays replaceelements may return different reference since the array length might not match 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should not able reach last without maxposition being set unless there are results 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not use proxiesbykey since not all proxies that point this sessions instances are that collection 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this should call resolve not resolveidentifier cos might propertyref and did not cache the referenced value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have ttnotfoundignorett association mapped formula always need dirty check can update the secondlevel cache 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 now have the value the propertyref reference however need dig little deeper that property might also entity type which case need resolve its identitifier 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 true this query and are loading multiple instances the same collection role otherwise this and are loading single collection batch 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 persister 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this method should implemented assuming its valid startstopstart leave state appropriate for another start 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont want waste effort setting option jbc already local mode jbc replasync then check they passed config option disable query replication 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 see had invalidation from the same initial preinvalidation timestamp only increment the new current value increase 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the workspace node has null well not weve been modified noncomparable manner which have treat being newer 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 maintain correct duplication loaded cartesian product 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 datasource unpooled jdbcurl

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have created the pool ourselves shut down 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the load which takes entity does not pass entityname 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note expected the syntax typelistenerclass where sep any whitespace comma 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 tree cache optimistic mode seems have very difficult time with remove calls nonexistent nodes npes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 does not refer alias projection look for property 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nothing for persistent instances 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 optimisticcache impl 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 assume true since dont really know and doesnt matter 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 show the modified ast 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note firstrow zerobased 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 initialize dirty flags for arrays collections with composite elements and reset reached doupdate etc 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 tell the dot node about the join type 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 among other things updatereachables will recursively load all collections that are moving roles this might cause entities loaded 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 postflushing section 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 otherwise recreate the mapping between the collection and its key 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 create parameter specification for the collection filter 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 attach any mappingdefined order fragments 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 found some extends attributes referencing entities which were not already processed here need locate all entitynames and classnames contained this document itself making sure that these get removed from the extendz list such that only extends names which require delay processing external this document and not yet processed are contained the returned result 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make sure that the persister versioned 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for nativesql queries the param metadata determined outside any relation query plan because query plan creation andor retreival for nativesql query depends all the return types having been set which might not the case upfront when param metadata would most useful 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this function has template redirect output and catch the arguments 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use the assigned the instance 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 array holder found unwrappered array this cant occur because now always call wrap before getting here return ahnull true type 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 collection loaded the current session can not possibly the collection belonging the entity passed update 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the data type not association type could not have been the from clause 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need generate ids part this bulk insert note that this only supported for sequencestyle generators and postinsertstyle generators basically only indb generators 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 first look for reference projection alias 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 handle trace logging 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 there are collection fetches then further checks are needed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 commented out inspection int getwarningcount 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 session happens get serialized completely correct need make sure that unbinding that session occurs 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make sure alias applied the table name 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 switch 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use the explicitly declared select expression determine the return types indicated each select token 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 select clauses for insert statements should alwasy treated shallow 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 after that process the joins invoke delegate the work this farily complex 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 cache impl 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 simple cache param metadata based query string ideally the original usersupplied query string should used retreive this metadata not the paralistexpanded query string avoid unnecessary cache entries used solely for caching param metadata for nativesql queries see for discussion why 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 alias references and identifiers use the same node class 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make new one 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 these are just two unrelated table references 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 again both should fromelements 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check set parentchild nodes the fromclause tree determine comma required between them 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 phase analyze the hql ast and produce sql ast 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 phase generate the sql 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 otherwise have nonscalar select with defined collection fetches make sure that there only single root entity the return tuples 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 paramtranslations new 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 are already processing dotstructure 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should mean that such property was found 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 initialize the error handling delegate 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 was there explicit select expression 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 resolve everything this dot but dont resolve the placeholders yet 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not notbetween between 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 just add not parent 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 first save off the pertinent ids the return value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check see the connection autocommit mode connection means aggressive connection release outside jta transaction context must autocommit mode 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 first save off the pertinent ids saving the number pertinent ids for return 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 start performing the deletes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont forget resolve the argument resolve the collection function now 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 otherwise everything 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 rearrange the tree that the collection function the root and the lhs the path 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 protected regionrootlistener listener 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 inject the where after the parent 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 never include subclasses for implied from elements 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for pessimistic locking just want toss out our ref any old invalid root node and get the latest may null 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the rest only matters for optimistic locking where need establish the proper data version the region root 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 prepare the left hand side and get the data type 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this dot has already been resolved stop now 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the property another class 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 otherwise this primitive type 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 foobarssize also handles deprecated stuff like foobarsmaxelement for backwardness 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for timestamps default separate config 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 optimisticlockall include all updatable properties optimisticlockdirty include all properties are updating this time 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this property belongs the table and not specifically excluded from optimistic locking optimisticlockfalse 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 information about properties this class including inherited properties only really needed for updatableinsertable properties 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 here render the select column list based the properties defined being generated for partial component generation currently just reselect the whole component rather than trying handle the individual generated portions 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note addduplicatealias already performs nullness checks the alias 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the fromclauses are the same can little more aggressive terms what reuse 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 again null null here 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 otherwise subquery case dont reuse the fromelement are processing the fromclause the subquery 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 know only the lhshand type use that 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the referenced node text the special 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only the identifier property field name can reference the associated entitys

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 tell the destination fromelement includesubclasses 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the lhs collection use 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont resolve the node again 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 lists arrays sets maps bags 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have something like rhs 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 finish all the removes first take care possible unique constraints and that can take better advantage batching 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use combination foreign key columns and columns since the ordering removal and addition not guaranteed when child moves from one parent another 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make sure dont rerelease the same cache 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use different delegate than the nonoptimistic superclass default 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have something like lhs 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont create unique key cos some databases dont like nullable columns 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 isset collectionisset issorted collectionissorted 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 know only the rhshand type use that 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 jbc using invalidation dont want propagate changes use the timestamps cache manage invalidation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont hold the jbc node lock throughout the that prevents updates add zero low timeout option dont block waiting for txs that did put commit 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 double check the distributed cache 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 get exclusive right update jbc for this key from this node 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 one the other needs datetime for get into this method the first place 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add the condition the join sequence that qualifies the indexed element 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 sometimes use the element table alias sometimes use the umm collection table alias many many 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 now set the text for this node should the element columns

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 could register the session against the transaction even though not started but wed have guarentee ever getting the map entries cleaned aside from spawning threads 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 needed arrays 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this assumes you will want ignore any update counts 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo something with formulas 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 assertion 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 remove all the old entries 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 create all the new entries 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 delete all the deleted entries

SATD	 implement string value according the jls value may anything beanshell well disallow void undefined values should map them the empty string 
SATD	 this should before dockables are initialized 
SATD	 this right 
SATD	 should this for both cases above 
SATD	 need loosen this any throwable need handle that interpreter somewhere check first 
SATD	 fucking gtk look and feel 
SATD	 note this implementation temporary currently keep flat namespace the base name classes beanshell cannot the process defining two classes different packages with the same base name remove this limitation requires that work through namespace imports analogous using the same path regular class import resolution this workaround should handle most cases well try for now 
SATD	 copy and paste from 
SATD	 wish could make this friendly only namespace 
SATD	 undocumented hack allow browser actions work xxx clean 
SATD	 look for default invoke handler method the namespace note this code duplicates that namespace getcommand that 
SATD	 this should per instance 
SATD	 can use the proxy mechanism cast bshthis the correct interface 
SATD	 redundant with constructor 
SATD	 issues resolve here which classloader should define the class there bshclassloader should define there should use reflection set nonbsh classloader there one should always create bsh classloader and expose its defineclass 
SATD	 could refactor these bit 
SATD	 note this class essentially just delegates most its methods its parent the setvariable indirection very small could probably fold this functionality back into the base namespace special case but this has changed few times like leave this abstraction for now 
SATD	 simplified these settings little 
SATD	 should check for strict java here and use isjavaassignable instead 
SATD	 workaround for swing rendering labels starting with html using the html engine 
SATD	 look for default invoke handler method the namespace note this code duplicates that thisjava should call this can never command 
SATD	 this method nightmare 
SATD	 consoleinterface the interpreter reflexively implements the console interface that uses should clean this using inner class implement the console for 
SATD	 caseinsensitive workaround 
SATD	 wrap nulls this bit cludge address deficiency the class generator whereby does not wrap nulls method delegate see class generatorjava fix that then can remove this just have generate the code there 
SATD	 switch eats multilevel break here not empty statement 
SATD	 check for field object note could eliminate throwing the exception somehow 
SATD	 xxxx reevaluate this can getsuper work itself now were class instance and the parent also class instance then super means our parent 
SATD	 wish protected access were limited children and not also package scope want this singleton implemented various children 
SATD	 imported full name wasnt found absolute class compound try resolve inner class maybe this should happen the bshclassmanager 
SATD	 cant this combined with run run seems have stuff for interactive noninteractive compare them side side and see what they differently aside from the exception handling 
SATD	 null value just declaration note might want keep any existing value here instead reset 
SATD	 can this factored out should adding the here instead 
SATD	 catch the mismatch and continue try the next note this innefficient should have isassignablefrom that doesnt throw 
SATD	 should use tryfinally here pop 
SATD	 note this could made clearer adding inner class for the cases and object context for the child traversal 
SATD	 hack sticking first interpreter that resolves this see comments type instance variable 
SATD	 note incorrect here are using the hack bsh class manager that allows lookup base name need eliminate this limitation working through imports see notes class manager 
SATD	 this the namespace which the method set backreference for the node which needs execute under this namespace not necessary declare this transient because can only saved part our namespace anyway currently 
SATD	 replace this cocoa api calls later 
SATD	 scripting classes currently requires accessibility this can eliminated with bit more work 
SATD	 this could static 
SATD	 thanks slava pestov jedit fame for import caching enhancements note this class has gotten too big should broken down bit 
SATD	 register attribute declaration for later retrieval format string type string default value int value type todo something with attribute types 
SATD	 todo get cast and boxing working byte the basetype wrapper type then need get the primitive type class for the base type here order for the cast allow then boxing will happen naturally the arrayset integer 
SATD	 note will move this behavior out subclass namespace but well start here 
SATD	 this particularly nasty bit code that checks for parameter entity reference but peeks ahead catch the parameter entity declarations 
SATD	 should cache this subject classloader change message evaluation the formal parameter simply resolves its type via the specified namespace doesnt modify the namespace 
SATD	 notes would not hard eliminate the use orgobjectwebasmtype from this class making the distribution tiny bit smaller 
SATD	 stupid caret will automatically incremented 
SATD	 spacing workaround 
SATD	 dont know any other way fix this since invoking this command from menu results the focus owner being the menu until the menu goes away 
SATD	 little hack for reverse replace and find 
SATD	 static methods that operate compound separated names guess could move these stringutil someday 
SATD	 note which these things should checked parse time run time 
SATD	 this part sucks 
SATD	 windows bug workaround case yesno confirm was shown 
SATD	 clear name resolvers dont know this necessary 
SATD	 this stupid and misleading but path not used anywhere except the above line and this done after the continue then will either hang forced duplicate inside the buffer null add finally clause you decide which ones worse 
SATD	 too tired think better way handle this right now 
SATD	 hacked bufferiorequest send vfsupdates case two stage save off now 
SATD	 some other primitive should avoid calling methods primitive name cant treat primitive like object message but the hole useful right now 
SATD	 change the parent which was the class static the class instance really need check were static inner class here first but for some reason java wont show the static modifier our fake inner classes could generate flag field 
SATD	 this where checked exceptions piss off this method only uses stringreader which can never throw exception 
SATD	 any subexpressions didnt terminate they dont count todo check this code ever gets hit 
SATD	 parse pattern into tokens does anyone know its more efficient use char than stringcharat assuming 
SATD	 note object only used here for precondition get rid 
SATD	 why both these 
SATD	 cut off from parent must have our own class manager cant this the run command needs resolve stuff should default when create namespace will parent class manager 
SATD	 note the bsh command code should probably not here need scope the namespace that imported the command probably needs integrated into namespace 
SATD	 this could smarter 
SATD	 was explicitly imported but dont know what should throw error here 
SATD	 note need form eval that passes the callstack through 
SATD	 primary interpreter set and get variable methods note these are squeltching errors should they 
SATD	 workaround for jdk bug where systeminavailable returns too large value this bug has been fixed jdk 
SATD	 somewhat hack the special fields are visible were operating relative this type already dissallow further this references prevent user from skipping things like superthiscaller 
SATD	 should clean this single return statement 
SATD	 implementation notes note may need some synchronization here note version dependency this base class jdk compatible however are forced use weak references the full featured implementation the optional bshclasspath package accomodate all the fleeting namespace listeners they fall out scope namespaces must informed the class space changes that they can uncache names perhaps simpler idea would have entities that reference cached types always perform light weight check with counter reference value and use that detect changes the namespace this puts the burden the consumer check appropriate times but could eliminate the need for the listener system many places and the necessity weak references this package 
SATD	 note this impor pattern becoming common could factor out into importedobject vector class 
SATD	 not sure should really recurse here for explicitly imported class parent 
SATD	 the following two boolean checks were tacked this could probably smoothed out 
SATD	 notes this broken finds public but less specific methods over nonpublic but more specific ones needs rewritten eliminate should implement the that uses the publiconly flag should also operate two passes give standard java assignable matches priority over extended bsh type matches 
SATD	 unixworkaround constructor 
SATD	 drag and drop support just move the code jedittextarea but depends jdk apis 
SATD	 next version remove this 
SATD	 compatibility kludge for jedit and earlier 
SATD	 stupid scrollbar policy attempt work around bugs people have been seeing with ibms jdk sep 
SATD	 this weird hack dont want insert the search bar the search bar has focus 
SATD	 aha this probably the only way fix this 
SATD	 this dirty hack and relies the fact that updates for parents are sent before updates for the changed nodes themselves this was not the case the browser wouldnt updated properly delete etc avoid causing request errors dont reload directory request already active 
SATD	 consume this work around the bug where atab window switching activates the menu bar windows 
SATD	 guess translated events not have the evt field set consuming wont work dont think this problem nothing uses translation anyway 
SATD	 this hack and really needs done better 
SATD	 copy and paste from resyntaxmatcher make syntax package independent jedit itself 
SATD	 stupidity 
SATD	 this doesnt seem very correct but fixes problem when setting the initial caret position for buffer from the recent file list 
SATD	 dont try this home 
SATD	 silly that reference the vertical scroll bar here directly this that the horizontal scroll bar flush with the vertical scroll bar 
SATD	 xxx clean this conditional 
SATD	 temporary hack support inner classes the obj nonstatic inner class then import the context this not sufficient emulation inner classes replace this later 
SATD	 workaround for swings annoying processing labels starting with html which often breaks 
SATD	 fucking gtk look and feel 
SATD	 hack that select all does not change current buffer 
SATD	 occurence occurs the beginning the selection the selection start will get moved this sucks hack avoid 
SATD	 silly bug workaround you look the above code note that restore the saved caret position first then scroll the saved location however the caret changing can itself result scrolling different location than what was saved and since movecaretposition calls the bracket highlights out bounds calculation will rely different set physical firstlast lines than what will end with eventually instead confusing the user with status messages that appear random when switching buffers simply hide the message altogether 
SATD	 this sloppy hack fix bug hitting return after collapsed fold the idea that extend the range then the problem described the bug happends the insert the very end the range dont extend instead push the insert into the next range however for this work properly also have mess with screen line counts 
SATD	 need this bullshit scroll bar policy for the preferred size hack work 
SATD	 xxx keep the createclassmanager getclassmanager then can axe this 
SATD	 note this class messy the method and field resolution need rewritten various methods here catch nosuchmethod nosuchfield exceptions during their searches these should rewritten avoid having catch the exceptions method lookups are now cached high level they are less important however the logic messy 
SATD	 the sooner ppl move the new api the less well need crap like this 
SATD	 nasty hardcoded values 
SATD	 xxx magic number 
SATD	 workaround for uncooperative windows 
SATD	 have this hack until vfspath class written 
SATD	 stupid swing 
SATD	 none the others are ever meant removed retarded this needs fixed eventually for plugins might want weird stuff jedits 
SATD	 this retarded excuse while drool and make stupid noises 
SATD	 retarded gtk look and feel 
SATD	 should probably error 
SATD	 there must better way fixing this the problem that this method can sometimes called result text area scroll event which case the caret position has not been updated yet 
SATD	 perhaps here would want guard with property for parallel backups not 
SATD	 this such bad way doing but well 
SATD	 while this might questionable some menus depend properties 
SATD	 get available screens this nasty but since arent dealling with many items should fine 
SATD	 methods that really shouldnt public 
SATD	 unixworkaround class 
SATD	 perhaps xerces wasnt slightly braindamaged would not need this 
SATD	 moved guiutilities makes sense being here 
SATD	 hack need more direct way obtaining view method 
SATD	 review how resolve this discrepancy 
SATD	 ugly workaround 
SATD	 windows work around 
SATD	 hack since helpviewer needs url 
SATD	 why object the args 
SATD	 should implement getminimumlength any ideas 
SATD	 move 
SATD	 they never taught you this undergrad computer science 
SATD	 should cache info not class case too 
SATD	 wtf 
SATD	 xxx hairy code that basically just functional port some other code barely understood 
SATD	 first try for accessible version the exact match this first lookup seems redundant with below but apparently needed this whole thing messy 
SATD	 work around for broken ftp plugin 
SATD	 hack move the spaces the front 
SATD	 this feels sloppy especially for nonus locales 
SATD	 hack get fixed length length field 
SATD	 have deal with assembly the programmer can writing little byte chunks for all know and must assemble complete records for writing review maybe this should tarbuffer could that help eliminate some the buffer copying 
SATD	 hack done fix bringing the window the front least windows frametofront doesnt cut remove the iswindows check its broken under other oses too 
SATD	 this method should rewritten use getfields and avoid catching exceptions during the search 
SATD	 hack 
SATD	 this should probably reflectjava 
SATD	 notes see notes this method should rolled into 
SATD	 note using signaturekey this way dangerous the pathological case user could eat memory caching every possible combination argument types untyped method maybe could smarter about ignoring the types untyped parameter positions the method resolver could return set hints for the signature key caching there also the overhead creating one these for every method dispatched what the alternative 
SATD	 crusty workaround 
SATD	 workaround for akeys producing garbage windows 
SATD	 addtofavorites which static method for convinience needs instance the vfs pass hence this hack 
SATD	 allow getthis work through blocknamespace the method namespace xxx reeval this need 
SATD	 these are used eliminate code duplication dont normally use the visitor template method pattern but this code was contributed peter cox and dont feel like changing around too much 
SATD	 fuck dead 
SATD	 stupid hack handle referencing rule set that defined later 
SATD	 jdk workaround 
SATD	 should the next two public maybe 
SATD	 note this method and should rewritten invert this logic that exceptions need caught unecessarily this just temporary impl return the field null not found 
SATD	 note need singleton here that things like this this work and probably good idea for speed caching single instance here seems technically incorrect considering the could different under some circumstances case child interpreter running source eval command however the effect just that the main interpreter that executes your script should the one involved callbacks from java not know there are corner cases where child interpreter would the first use this reference namespace that would even cause any problems did could some experiments find out and necessary could cache per interpreter basis had weak references might also look skipping over child interpreters and going the parent for the declaring interpreter wed sure get the top interpreter 
SATD	 resolve relative class type static field inner class 
SATD	 some regexps itself have length implement this hack you dont understand whats going here then back watching mtv 
SATD	 optimization classofstaticmethod set then have already been here and determined that this static method invocation note maybe factor this out with path below clean 
SATD	 this will probably not get used object type 
SATD	 windows jdk workaround 
SATD	 this listener priority thing bad hack 
SATD	 this doesnt look pretty and mode line should probably split into seperate componentsstrings 
SATD	 this stupid and misleading but path not used anywhere except the above line and this done after the continue then will either hang forced duplicate inside the buffer null add finally clause you decide which ones worse 
SATD	 workaround for hang match was zerowidth not sure there better way handle this 
SATD	 windows paths the form list the last working directory that drive list the root the drive you must use however the vfs browser and friends strip off trailing path separators for various reasons work around that add drive letter paths windows 
SATD	 unix set permissions port file that broken unices which give everyone read access user home dirs people cant see your port file and hence send arbitriary beanshell code your way nasty 
SATD	 this should only called with fully loaded action set 
SATD	 broken eclipse workaround febuary 
SATD	 notes this broken finds public but less specific methods over nonpublic but more specific ones this method needs rewritten eliminate should implement the that uses the publiconly flag should also operate two passes give standard java assignable matches priority over extended bsh type matches 
SATD	 xxx this should not hardcoded 
SATD	 interval operator reintervals renobkbraces reintervals renobkbraces open question what proper interpretation start string 
SATD	 xxx does this really belong here 
SATD	 need save every possible point but the number clone invocations here really killer for performance nonstingy repeat operators open suggestions 
SATD	 note this should really just throw need change related signatures and code 
SATD	 split the methods into constructors and regular method lists 
SATD	 need add static block here

SATD	 implement the recursion for getclassimpl 
SATD	 need some format checking here 
SATD	 need calculate this just fudging here for now 
SATD	 todo also check reganchorindex anchor 
SATD	 skip header bytes maybe should check theyre valid not 
SATD	 debug utils are static that they are reachable code that doesnt necessarily have interpreter reference tracing utils the future may want allow debugtrace turned per interpreter basis which case well need use the parent reference some way determine the scope the command that turns off 
SATD	 parse elementcontent model elements choice seq cps choice ctokplus ctoks ctokplus cps cps ctoks cps cps seq stoks stoks stoks cps cps note the opening and have already been read todo over parameter entity boundaries more carefully

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 step explained above resizing instruction may require resize another one which may require resize yet another one and the first step the algorithm consists finding all the instructions that need resized without modifying the code this done the following fix point algorithm parse the code find the jump instructions whose offset will need more than bytes stored the future offset computed from the current offset and from the number bytes that will inserted removed between the source and target instructions for each such instruction adds entry copy the indexes and sizes arrays this has not already been done previous iteration least one entry has been added during the previous step back the beginning otherwise stop fact the real algorithm complicated the fact that the size tableswitch and lookupswitch instructions depends their position the bytecode because padding order ensure the convergence the algorithm the number bytes added removed from these instructions over estimated during the previous loop and computed exactly only after the loop finished this requires another pass parse the bytecode the method

SATD	 this may negative 
SATD	 todo implemented 
SATD	 todo the subplot areas needs moved out the plot into the plot state 
SATD	 todo shift block down bottom 
SATD	 todo might good idea keep reference the color specified setpaint setcolor rather than creating new object every time getpaint called 
SATD	 todo for now are ignoring the height constraint 
SATD	 first determine the size the chart rendering area todo workout insets for swt 
SATD	 todo implement properly 
SATD	 todo this must wrong 
SATD	 todo didnt check the width yet 
SATD	 hack ensure the newly created awt fonts will rendered with the same height the swt one 
SATD	 todo shift block right half 
SATD	 fixme need locale well timezone 
SATD	 todo shift block over right 
SATD	 need update the crosshair values 
SATD	 todo find better localization key 
SATD	 todo this attribute should transferred the renderer state 
SATD	 fixme implement this low priority 
SATD	 fixme the xyitemrenderer interface doesnt specify the getannotations method but should 
SATD	 defer argument checking 
SATD	 calculate the adjusted data area taking into account the effect this assumes that there renderer all this effect bit ugly hack 
SATD	 todo add constructors for combinations number and date formatters 
SATD	 todo move plot state 
SATD	 here tweak the notify flag the plot that only one notification happens even though update multiple axes 
SATD	 defer argument checking 
SATD	 fixme should really assert value here 
SATD	 these annotations only work with xyplot see possible make contourplot subclass xyplot 
SATD	 fixme should really assert value 
SATD	 not strictly necessary since the renderer set for the parent plot not used 
SATD	 todo complete this 
SATD	 todo fix output when this flag set true 
SATD	 todo move the above the plot state 
SATD	 fixme this code means that not possible use more than one domain axis for the combined plots 
SATD	 end workaround 
SATD	 todo could change this itemfillpaint for backwards compatibility might require usefillpaint flag 
SATD	 redraw should not trigger another change event 
SATD	 unused parent 
SATD	 todo jfreechart put this method the interface 
SATD	 todo rotate the image when drawn with horizontal orientation 
SATD	 todo implement this properly 
SATD	 fixme this should generate series change event 
SATD	 create entities fixme these methods should defined 
SATD	 fixme the renderer interface doesnt have the drawdomainline method have rely the renderer being subclass which lame 
SATD	 fixme this attribute not used deprecate 
SATD	 todo coding the event with some information about what changed the dataset could make the recalculation the interval more efficient some cases for instance the change just update yvalue then the xinterval doesnt need updating 
SATD	 the method want isnt the interface 
SATD	 fixme what value null next line 
SATD	 todo this needs move into the renderer state 
SATD	 todo implement this method properly 
SATD	 hack ensure the newly created swt fonts will rendered with the same height the awt one 
SATD	 unused but must return something while are 
SATD	 fixme perhaps should clone the data list 
SATD	 are rendering the values percentages need calculate the total for the current item unfortunately here end repeating the calculation more times than strictly necessary hopefully ill come back this and find way add the totals the renderer state the other problem implicitly assume the dataset has negative valuesperhaps that can fixed too 
SATD	 note would nice precalculate this per series 
SATD	 assume that all other paint instances implement equals and hashcodeof course that might not true but what can about 
SATD	 fixme use other fields too 
SATD	 all attributes are immutable can just return the superclone fixme fact the generator itself immutable cloning not necessary 
SATD	 heres quirk the api has been defined terms plain timeperiod which cannot make use the timezone and locale specified the constructorso only the time zone pegging the period instanceof regulartimeperiod 
SATD	 now handle specific plot types and yes know this some really ugly code that has manually updated any time new plot type added should have written something much cooler but didnt and neither did anyone else 
SATD	 todo urlencode 
SATD	 todo revert svn revision jfreechart jdk issues todo then change visibility all darker methods except darkerpaint private 
SATD	 todo replace getsize getbounds 
SATD	 todo check threshold 
SATD	 fixme add boolean 
SATD	 fixme add boolean 
SATD	 now handle some special cases yes ugly code alert 
SATD	 fixme probably makes sense allocate array colors and lazily populate this array 
SATD	 todo need fetch this from localised resources 
SATD	 fixme getvalueformat method 
SATD	 here could probably little faster searching for both indices simultaneously but ill look that later seems like matters 
SATD	 todo complete this 
SATD	 fixme this attribute never used deprecate 
SATD	 fixme clone the attributed string not null 
SATD	 report this 
SATD	 this may obsolete not used anywhere 
SATD	 todo this good idea 
SATD	 kludge make everything work when rows returned 
SATD	 todo shift block down half 
SATD	 fixme better ask the renderer instead datasetutilities 
SATD	 todo implement the entity for the annotation 
SATD	 needs improved 
SATD	 not used plot 
SATD	 fixme need locale well timezone 
SATD	 todo for jfreechart this method should the shapeutilities class 
SATD	 well have use the method the interface but this doesnt have the paint and stroke settings 
SATD	 fixme check that there isnt already series with the same key 
SATD	 know its bad create object better idea 
SATD	 fixme clone generator 
SATD	 todo use generator here 
SATD	 todo think need make sure the keys are actually cloned whereas the paint instances are always immutable theyre 
SATD	 fixme draw outliers 
SATD	 todo think need make sure the keys are actually cloned whereas the stroke instances are always immutable theyre 
SATD	 not implemented 
SATD	 returns string representing the week week todo look return string representing the week 
SATD	 fixme show dialog with the error 
SATD	 todo draw the interval marker with effect 
SATD	 todo add serialization support for images 
SATD	 could make this configurable 
SATD	 todo see need apply some line color and style the axis traces 
SATD	 fixme implement this 
SATD	 annotation that allows image placed some location link xyplot todo implement serialization properly image not serializable

SATD	 method broken anyway 
SATD	 todo this sensible number nonnls 
SATD	 todo work out how search the xml pane

SATD	 todo validate contenttype for reasonable types 
SATD	 mask values for testtype todo remove either match contains they are mutually exckusive 
SATD	 todo ought filechooser 
SATD	 allow jmeter render frames and relative images must done after setcontenttype why 
SATD	 todo this used apart from test code 
SATD	 todo should this cleardata

SATD	 add system property samplers can check see jmeter running nongui mode nonnls todo why does create new instance 
SATD	 should run beanshell script startup nonnls 
SATD	 little hack add each listener the start the list this ensures that the thread running the show the first listener and can modify certain values before other listeners are called 
SATD	 todo move this components the only reason why its core because its used guinea pig couple tests 
SATD	 todo this bit code needs tidied unfortunately modulecontroller components not core bug 
SATD	 todo this class looks lot like argumentspanel what exactly the difference could they combined note seems that this class not actually used 
SATD	 todo does not appear used 
SATD	 ensure that the sample variables are correctly initialised for each run todo this the best way this should done elsewhere

SATD	 not used 
SATD	 todo perhaps save other items such headers 
SATD	 todo should class implement samplelistener

SATD	 todo turn into method 
SATD	 does not appear used yet 
SATD	 todo perhaps use concurrenthashmap 
SATD	 todo clazz probably always the same testclass 
SATD	 todo should this restored 
SATD	 todo provide proper name 
SATD	 todo does matter that empty line will terminate the loop csv output files should never contain empty lines probably not then need check whether the reader eof 
SATD	 todo convert work more like special processing carried out for the header class the string property testelementname converted headername for example elementprop nameuseragent stringprop stringprop elementprop becomes elementprop nameuseragent stringprop stringprop elementprop 
SATD	 these must set before readingwriting the xml rather hack but saves changing all the method calls include extra variable afaik the variables should only accessed from one thread need synchronize 
SATD	 todo should this restored 
SATD	 todo not used make private 
SATD	 todo appears duplicate the threadname field sampleresult 
SATD	 yuck tiffimageencoder uses error report runtime problems 
SATD	 check just case 
SATD	 todo this the right thing 
SATD	 todo what code should set here 
SATD	 todo should this implement 
SATD	 not used the testresult element generated the resultcollector class 
SATD	 check string valid jmeter expression the current implementation very basic just accepts any string containing valid expression todo improve but keep returning true for 
SATD	 todo use remove 
SATD	 guess this can happen result bad file read this case would better replace the incorrect value with anything valid the default value for the property but for the time being just prefer aware any problems occuring here most likely programming errors ill bail out note cant bail out newly create elements have blank values and must get the defaults also when loading previous versions jmeter test scripts some values may not right and should get default values todo review this and possibly change 
SATD	 todo does not work yet need determine the sample type 
SATD	 temporary fix allow default protocol changed 
SATD	 todo consider using private logs for each derived class 
SATD	 does not appear used yet 
SATD	 remember change this when the class changes 
SATD	 todo temporary hack avoid unnecessary bug reports for subclasses 
SATD	 todo yet another ambiguous name does need changing see also clearable jmeterguicomponent 
SATD	 todo this silent exception intended 
SATD	 the following variables are set this done before start called the values will published the thread safely todo consider passing them the constructor that they can made final avoid adding lots parameters perhaps have parameter wrapper object 
SATD	 todo should this set the thread names for all the subsamples might more efficient than fetching the name elsewehere 
SATD	 setting samplingstarted before the contollers are initialised allows them access the running values functions and variables however does not seem help with the listeners 
SATD	 todo remove this useless entry parameter 
SATD	 todo fix this when there real implementation 
SATD	 todo only clear the relevant entry possible 
SATD	 surely this always null the constructor 
SATD	 todo why not use the super class value 
SATD	 todo does not appear called directly 
SATD	 custom trustmanager ignores all certificate errors todo implement conditional checking and logging derived from httpclient contrib directory 
SATD	 maps contain page and form encodings todo these really need shared between all proxy instances 
SATD	 note source and line arguments are nonsense call any way make these arguments sensible 
SATD	 exception wrapped javascriptexception 
SATD	 todo why empty block 
SATD	 todo perhaps this should fatal error 
SATD	 clone will produce correct type todo but why need clone the list 
SATD	 todo only called which deprecated class 
SATD	 todo probably not needed 
SATD	 todo needs synch probably not changed after threads have started jmeter home directory excludes trailing separator jmeter bin directory excludes trailing separator 
SATD	 hack bshbjar bshscriptengine implements compilable but throws javalangerror unimplemented 
SATD	 todo what this for 
SATD	 todo should equals and hashcode depend field other than count 
SATD	 todo sync really needed 
SATD	 todo this correct 
SATD	 todo cpercent the same cmedian here why and why pass distributionline 
SATD	 todo should the method signature this method changed match the superimplementation using testelement parameter instead this would require instanceof check before adding the listener below but would also make the behavior bit more obvious for subclasses the java rules dealing with this situation arent always intuitive and subclass may think calling this version the method when really calling the superclass version instead 
SATD	 todo should this method synchronized all other function execute are 
SATD	 todo should the engine static 
SATD	 commons ioutils has equivalent methods these were added before was included todo perhaps deprecate these favour commons 
SATD	 todo should this getmin 
SATD	 fix bug argarg was causing parse error however define argarg this seems because the parser skips the terminator for the long options but was not doing for the short options 
SATD	 todo improve the error handling 
SATD	 add logtargets root logger fixme whats the clean way add logtarget afterwards param logtargets logtarget array 
SATD	 hack reduce the need load every class nongui mode which only needs functions todo perhaps use bcel scan class files instead class name should contain this string class name should not contain this string 
SATD	 todo exact ordering only required for some tests change the comparison set compare where necessary 
SATD	 todo field always true what for 
SATD	 todo improve this check 
SATD	 todo could this return 
SATD	 very wrong 
SATD	 todo should this failure 
SATD	 wrapper convert junit class into testcase todo work out how convert junit assertions they are treated failures rather than errors 
SATD	 todo should really return most specific longest match 
SATD	 todo should this done for embedded usage note the element configtestelement when used standalone cannot use ftpsampler access methods 
SATD	 todo replace all this url mess with proper method areequivalenturl url that would also ignore case protocol and host names etc use that method the cookiemanager too 
SATD	 todo this possible 
SATD	 holder for storing cache details perhaps add original response later 
SATD	 todo not used gui 
SATD	 not currently used 
SATD	 todo correct url 
SATD	 note the handling simple doublequotes could formally more accurate but cant imagine session containing either should the whole set expressions quick hack anyway who cares 
SATD	 todo improve string version better match browser behaviour browsers regard httphost and httphost the same would better reflect this the string 
SATD	 code also allows for only not sure why perhaps because the test code uses 
SATD	 todo find way avoid the cost creating string here probably new patternmatcherinput working byte would better 
SATD	 todo should setbaseforscript called here rather than above 
SATD	 java longer allows contentlength set dont check see todo any point checking the other headers 
SATD	 sampleevent not passed jmetervariables because they dont make sense for proxy recording todo this the correct threadgroup name 
SATD	 todo needs cleaning 
SATD	 nonnls todo should this variable 
SATD	 todo replace repeated substr above and below with more efficient method 
SATD	 todo perhaps make more specific than this point parsing anything else gif 
SATD	 wont work generate result nec and populate hack skip processing 
SATD	 todo should this done when the client created then the details need added part httpclientkey 
SATD	 hack 
SATD	 may replaced later 
SATD	 todo hack removed later 
SATD	 could drop the sync here 
SATD	 todo should lfonly eol allowed 
SATD	 dircontext todo perhaps return this 
SATD	 nonnls todo change use url version will this affect test plans 
SATD	 todo specify collection type without breaking callers 
SATD	 todo can this eever happen 
SATD	 all form parameter always have textplain mime type todo make this parameter 
SATD	 nonnls todo can this obtained from the file somehow 
SATD	 does not appear used 
SATD	 notused guipackage guipack 
SATD	 allow serializable test work todo the serializable test necessary now that jmetertreenode longer gui component 
SATD	 todo null correct 
SATD	 todo how handle thread stopped here 
SATD	 slight hack need ensure the testclass not reset the previous call 
SATD	 todo should this called basedir null 
SATD	 todo could converted generic class 
SATD	 todo not used 
SATD	 todo make static 
SATD	 hack allow entire url provided host field 
SATD	 todo should this sgetcontentencoding check arguments should have one argument with the value equal the post body 
SATD	 todo downcase upper case nonfinal variables 
SATD	 todo belongs elsewhere 
SATD	 todo can this happen 
SATD	 todo needed here because currently done sample completion jmeterthread but that only catches toplevel samples 
SATD	 todo this bit fragile 
SATD	 todo this correct this not the first file cant write its header now for simplicity always save even there only one file 
SATD	 todo should this return something else 
SATD	 dont allow override contentlength this helps with soapsampler hack too todo what other headers are not allowed 
SATD	 nonnls todo should this variable 
SATD	 todo this the correct default 
SATD	 todo need add charset for the file contents nonnls 
SATD	 todo merge put and post methods far possible post checks for multipart formfiles and not invokes 
SATD	 get the content length tells how much data read todo maybe support chunked encoding then cannot rely content length 
SATD	 todo this the correct default 
SATD	 todo should allow mimetype only 
SATD	 todo should these fields public they dont appear used externally also are they any different from httpconstantsget etc some cases they seem used the method name from the tomcat log however the rmethod field used the value for for which httpconstants most approriate 
SATD	 notused todo charset 
SATD	 todo find out how retrieve these from the script present the script has use sampleresult methods set them nonnls nonnls 
SATD	 todo process warnings set code and message success 
SATD	 todo should the encoding configurable nonnls 
SATD	 nonnls todo probably wrong 
SATD	 todo method with reference really useful 
SATD	 maybe should consider creating global cache for the random files make jmeter more efficient 
SATD	 should use create the queueconnection 
SATD	 todo set different status not enough messages found 
SATD	 fixme broken code 
SATD	 notused private string chosenfile 
SATD	 find all beans out there and check their resource property files check that nondefault property files dont have any extra keys check all necessary properties are defined least the default property file except for beans whose name contains experimental alpha todo check property files dont have duplicate keys this important 
SATD	 this could perhaps variable name 
SATD	 should add the separator 
SATD	 todo should skip processing here 
SATD	 todo add some real tests now that split has been removed 
SATD	 not used transient protected threadgroup threadgroup null anyway was this supposed the class from javalang jmeterthreads 
SATD	 all the others could private too 
SATD	 todo can this ever happen 
SATD	 todo fetch list languages from file changes language list need reflected 
SATD	 todo move utils class jmeterutils 
SATD	 todo need implement any kind connection pooling which connections should shared should threads share connections the same destination what about crossthread sharing 
SATD	 set the content type todo needed string 
SATD	 todo this assumes that the redirected response will always immediately follow the original response this may not always true there better way this 
SATD	 todo the best way 
SATD	 keep the unexpanded path todo allow directories end with jar removing this check 
SATD	 todo the above works the current situation but its just hack how get each editor report whether wants grow bigger whether the property label should the left the top the editor 
SATD	 hack save the package for any transaction controllers 
SATD	 how many classes can assign from todo there must nicer way 
SATD	 should the testbean hidden 
SATD	 todo why lower case use the default locale 
SATD	 hack make userdefined variables the testplan element more dynamic 
SATD	 hack force the controller load its tree 
SATD	 might useful also make this available the request tab for when posting json 
SATD	 should header saved with the data nonnls 
SATD	 showing large strings can very costly will avoid doing the response data larger than todo instead could delay doing the resultsettext call until the user chooses the response data tab plus could warn the user this happens and revert the choice doesnt confirm hes ready wait 
SATD	 todo strings should resources 
SATD	 resultseterrortrue todo this the correct strategy throw exception allow assertion pass 
SATD	 why does this not call there reason for not clearing everything 
SATD	 notused yet private jtextfield filename 
SATD	 todo somehow show progress 
SATD	 todo support multiple signers 
SATD	 todo fetch this once per vars above 
SATD	 todo add and delete not currently supported nonnls 
SATD	 fix path allow the use unc urls 
SATD	 todo should this use setdone todo should this use setfirst 
SATD	 set the overall status for the transaction sample todo improve adding counts the sampleresult class 
SATD	 should exit end the test only applies server because host nonnull 
SATD	 have reached the reporting boundary need allow for margin error otherwise can miss the slot also need check weve not hit the window already 
SATD	 todo save hostname save sample type plain http 
SATD	 allow the mimetype the file control the content type this not obvious gui you are not uploading any files but just sending the content nameless parameters todo needs multiple file upload scenerio 
SATD	 remind convert arg list vectors here 
SATD	 chunked transfer encoding which not really support yet just read without blocking because not know when stop reading cannot block todo propery implement support for chunked transfer know when have read the whole request and therefore allow the reading block 
SATD	 todo handle filenames 
SATD	 not yet handled 
SATD	 todo should check that error has been logged 
SATD	 dont allow override contentlength todo what other headers are not allowed

SATD	 basically ignore protocol let someone report 
SATD	 sss fixme this correct 
SATD	 fixme use for block implement end node because need proc which captures its enclosing scope forblock now represents these node and should renamed 
SATD	 sss fixme the ordering correct poll before next 
SATD	 use highly uncommon string represent the paragraph delimiter soln not worth 
SATD	 add self recv here todo this right 
SATD	 todo mri behavior call add depending the call but this leads exceptions when floats are added see return callcoercedcontext true this mri behavior well use ours for now thus providing ability add floats 
SATD	 sss fixme this correctly placed the end the loop iteration 
SATD	 todo ruby reuses this logic for other write behavior checking its and calling write again 
SATD	 sss fixme where does this 
SATD	 would nice and logical exponent form behaved like and decimal form behaved like but such luck hence 
SATD	 sss fixme these should get normally compiled initialized some other way sss fixme parentsupertype info incorrect these are just placeholders for now this needs updated with real class objects later 
SATD	 todo probably here confirm jruby 
SATD	 sss fixme could make irloop scope too semantically scope but functionally not sure this required yet 
SATD	 this covers the rare case lowercase class names and thus will fail the time fortunately well only this once per package name and seriously folks look into best practices 
SATD	 sss fixme should this string literal string dummy class for the script 
SATD	 todo should this deprecated efficient internals should deal with rubyhash directly 
SATD	 sss fixme does int suffice need long 
SATD	 modules are included with shim class must find that shim handle super appropriately 
SATD	 reset value map this instruction the startend basic block right now calls are considered hard boundaries for optimization and information cannot propagated across them sss fixme rather than treat all calls with broad brush what need capture different attributes about call uses closures known call target can modify scope etc this information probably already present the ast inspector 
SATD	 todo determine whether should perhaps store nonsingleton class the implementationclass 
SATD	 sss fixme correct where does closure arg come from 
SATD	 fixme consider fixing nodeassign itself rather than single case 
SATD	 sss fixme should have reference the irloop that being retried 
SATD	 temporary hack handle nonruby values will come with better solution shortly 
SATD	 simplify the variables too keep these variables sync with what actually used the when clauses this not required for correctness reasons but only for performance reasons 
SATD	 must called from main thread currently but this bothers 
SATD	 con fixme dont know how make case expressiondoes that logic need here 
SATD	 fixme legal here may want 
SATD	 fixme this ugly hack resolve jruby not proud 
SATD	 something wrong dont know the cwd todo this behavior really desirable mov 
SATD	 todo java stringity 
SATD	 fixme total hack get flash rails session okwe need totally change marshalling work with overridden core classes 
SATD	 todo this method not present mri 
SATD	 fixme ideally javaobject instances should marshallable which means that the javaobject metaclass should have appropriate allocator jruby 
SATD	 todo public only 
SATD	 fixme this should probably some translation from ruby priority levels java priority levels until have green threads 
SATD	 todo consider better way synchronizing 
SATD	 using ioinputstream may not the most performance way but its easy 
SATD	 fixme should not regenerating this over and over 
SATD	 xxx this check previously used callmethod check for equality between classes when scanning the hierarchy however the check may safe should only ever have one instance bound given typeconstant its found unsafe examine ways avoid the call 
SATD	 todo why are duplicating the constants here and then fileconstants below fileconstants included 
SATD	 cloned method now belongs new class set todo make dynamicmethod immutable 
SATD	 todo these were missing were not handling them elsewhere 
SATD	 todo cache 
SATD	 fixme wtf this why would these use the class 
SATD	 todo figure out how this can happen and possibly remove 
SATD	 fixme dont like this 
SATD	 fixme these descriptions should probably moved out constantine project which deals with all platformdependent constants 
SATD	 fixme this below temporary but its much safer for cow prevents not shared strings with begin this allows now bytelistset not begin aware 
SATD	 todo what about arg 
SATD	 fixme think this chunk equivalent mri idname and not our public method idname make into method used more than once 
SATD	 fixme this probably not very efficient since loads all methods for each call 
SATD	 hack replace usual readline with this 
SATD	 get here found matching method use todo choose narrowest method continuing search 
SATD	 todo this kinda gross 
SATD	 fixme order for thread play well with the standard new behavior must provide allocator that can create empty object instances which initialize then fills with appropriate data 
SATD	 these extra arrays are really unfortunate split some these paths out eliminate 
SATD	 clone dynamic scope because this will new instance block any previously captured instances this block may still around and not want start overwriting those values when create new one enebo once make self lastclass and lastmethod immutable can remove duplicate 
SATD	 todo protected methods this going require rework some the mechanism 
SATD	 not overloaded add method that guesses which signature use todo just adding first one right nowadd signatureguessing logic 
SATD	 sss fixme this should never get called for constant svalues 
SATD	 todo this version better than the hackish previous one windows behavior needs defined though suppose this version could improved more too todo etcpasswd also inadequate for macosx since does not use etcpasswd for regular user accounts 
SATD	 fixme theres some code duplication here with rubyobjectinspect 
SATD	 for visibility checking without requiring frame self todo dont bother passing when fcall vcall and adjust callsite appropriately 
SATD	 fixme figure out why get null sometimes 
SATD	 hacky advance position eat newline here 
SATD	 need reexamine this 
SATD	 fixme this currently only here because some problems with iooutputstream writing bare runtime without proper scope 
SATD	 workaround for jruby 
SATD	 using iooutputstream may not the most performance way but its easy 
SATD	 ignorebean doesnt get registered todo why does that bother 
SATD	 enebo lots optz parser here 
SATD	 fixme move out this class 
SATD	 fact should probably raise error yes 
SATD	 todo arysortcheck should done here 
SATD	 todo get rid this lax returns strict will throw 
SATD	 bit risky someone changes completor but useful for method calls 
SATD	 todo the rest thisseeking same position unnecessary since share channel but some this may needed 
SATD	 todo this the right thing 
SATD	 fixme this probably belongs different package 
SATD	 fixme not very efficient 
SATD	 this gross but java apis arent iso compliant all 
SATD	 todo this correct 
SATD	 workaround for jruby mri does not enter this production for some reason 
SATD	 create block for this iter node fixme shouldnt use the current scope its not actually from the same hierarchy static scopes 
SATD	 sss fixme need check same whatever popped 
SATD	 sss fixme where this set how this diff from classvardeclnode 
SATD	 fixme need the check does mainjava not call thisthey should consolidate 
SATD	 fixme this table will get moved into posix library can get all actual supported signals this quick fix support basic signals until that happens 
SATD	 fixme this worries bit since could allocate lot with large newlength 
SATD	 todo this filtering kind grossit would nice get some parser help here 
SATD	 todo decompose dont parse fullname 
SATD	 fixme get rid laziness and handle restricted access elsewhere 
SATD	 todo for now use faithful reimplementation mris algorithm but should use utfencoding facilities from joni once starts prefroming utf content validation 
SATD	 dont have opt args start after args they will assigned later this for crap like def fooa true which numbers before fixme only starting after required args since opt args may access others and rest args conflicts with compileroot using indicate signature 
SATD	 fixme determine real allocator needed here people want extend javaclass want them that can you classnewjavaclass should you able todo probably here since dont intend for people monkey with this type and cant marshalled confirm jruby 
SATD	 grrr arghh want subclass but cant must all this the next lines code which has already been done floatingdecimal 
SATD	 fixme really want declared methods includes privateprotected and does not include superclass methods also the getdeclared calls may throw securityexception were running under restrictive security policy 
SATD	 small hack save cast later 
SATD	 this perhaps innefficient timewise optimal spacewise 
SATD	 todo confirm expected args are irubyobject similar 
SATD	 theres not compelling reason keep javaclass instances weak map any proxies created are were kept nonweak map most cases they will stick around anyway and some good reasons not javaclass creation expensive for one many lookups are performed when passing parameters tofrom methods etc todo faster custom concurrent map 
SATD	 todo check for java reserved names and raise exception encountered 
SATD	 fixme jruby ends with condition returning nullquick fix until can dig into 
SATD	 workaround for bug suns jdk see 
SATD	 fixme weakrefrb also does caller here for the backtrace 
SATD	 fixme remove this from grammars 
SATD	 todo its perhaps just coincidence that all the channels for which should raise are instanceof selectablechannel since stdio notso this bothers slightly con 
SATD	 fixme not sure what the semantics transfer are 
SATD	 fixme this pretty gross should have cleaner initialization that doesnt depend packagevisible fields and ideally atomic probably using immutable structure replace all once lazy null when groups defined 
SATD	 this dummy scope should find way make that more explicit 
SATD	 fixme resolve what the hell going 
SATD	 rbobjid return the internal object fixme should this renamed match its ruby name 
SATD	 again shouldnt happen todo might want throw exception instead 
SATD	 fixme maybe not best place but move good home 
SATD	 todo may here but its unclear how structs work with marshalling confirm behavior and ensure were doing this correctly jruby 
SATD	 todo should next and return also catch here 
SATD	 always prepend orgjrubyproxy package the beginning because java and javax packages are protected and signed jars prevent generating new classes with those package names see jruby 
SATD	 todo should able optimize this quite bit post javaclass already has all the methods organized method name the next version supporting protected methodsfields will have them organized even further collectmethods here can just lookup the overridden methods the javaclass map should much faster 
SATD	 index for the item this could probably more efficient bailing out assigning args past the end 
SATD	 todo make more efficient not creating irubyarray 
SATD	 rbmodremovecvar fixme any good reason have two identical methods same removeclassvariable 
SATD	 from dupsetup rbcopygenericivar from dupsetup here unlikely 
SATD	 its singlearg when but contains array know its real literal array fixme this gross way figure out parser help similar yield argument passing expandarguments would better 
SATD	 todo only setaccessible account for pattern found accessing constants included from nonpublic interface aka being implemented many classes 
SATD	 not intended called directly users private old todo from ruby code this should implemented javaclassjava where can check for reserved ruby names conflicting methods etc 
SATD	 fixme dont allow multiple threads this once 
SATD	 todo bleeding runtime into parser arity may should parser keep bleeding oneway 
SATD	 rbarypushm fixme whis this named pushm 
SATD	 todo this probably isnt the best hack but works until can have different root frame setup for easily 
SATD	 todo least passes argsnode null implicitnil wrong magic for setupargs since will irubyobject nil need figure out nice fast null pattern for setupargs assert argsnode null receivernode not null 
SATD	 hack order have stdouterr act like ttys and flush always set anything assigned stdoutstderr sync 
SATD	 todo people extending gzipwriterreader will break find better way here 
SATD	 fixme set call configuration for this 
SATD	 process streams get channelnewchanneled into filechannel but are not actually seekable instead just the isseekable check doing instanceof filechannel must also add this boolean check which set false when its known that the incoming channel from process fixme this gross and its nios fault for not providing nice way tell channel really seekable 
SATD	 fixme somehow feel better this could get the appropriate var index from the argumentnode 
SATD	 fixme can get optimized for ieqlnode 
SATD	 todo rounding mode should not hardcoded see mode 
SATD	 fixme moved this here get whats obviously utility method out irubyobject perhaps security methods should find their own centralized home some point 
SATD	 fixme nativeexception expected used from ruby code should provide real allocator used otherwise classnew will fail will marshalling jruby 
SATD	 objecttoa obsolete match rubys hack until toa goes away then can remove this hack too 
SATD	 todo callback for value would more efficient but unlikely big cost constants are rarely assigned 
SATD	 fixme this should somewhere more generic maybe idutil 
SATD	 sss fixme move this code some utils area probably there already method for this some jruby utils class holy cow just append two darned arrays 
SATD	 todo set our metaclass targets class scary 
SATD	 add new with full signature its guaranteed directly accessible todo need for this full formal jvm signature 
SATD	 context null wipe out the softreference this could done with reference queue 
SATD	 todo remove 
SATD	 fixme big fat hack here because scope names are expected interned strings the parser 
SATD	 todo this actually now returning the scope whoever called methodtoproc which obviously wrong but theres scope provide for many methods fixes jruby but needs better solution 
SATD	 author headius fixme convert enum 
SATD	 the following three methods must defined fast since they expect modify the current frame they expect frame will allocated for them jruby 
SATD	 todo probably here since dont intend for people monkey with this type and cant marshalled confirm jruby 
SATD	 sss fixme can this return anything other than nil 
SATD	 xxx const lookup can trigger constmissing that enough warrant always being executed 
SATD	 todo should frozen error have its own distinct class not should more share 
SATD	 todo only used interface implementation eliminate 
SATD	 fixme null check removable once figure out how assign unset named block args 
SATD	 for jruby when met choose cet timezone work around joda 
SATD	 fixme this gross dont this 
SATD	 fixme think need these pushed somewhere 
SATD	 sss fixme deprecated going forward all instructions should come from the cfg 
SATD	 todo should probably apply the null object pattern for nonallowed class rather than null 
SATD	 yowthis still ugly 
SATD	 add method with full signature its guaranteed directly accessible todo need for this full formal jvm signature 
SATD	 fixme this version faster than the previous but both suffer from crucial flaw impossible create objectspace with iterator that doesnt either hold objects that might otherwise collected have way guarantee that call hasnext will correct that subsequent call next will produce object for our purposes for now this may acceptable 
SATD	 fixme clearing read buffer hereis this appropriate 
SATD	 todo specifying soft refs may want compare memory consumption behavior with weak refs specify weak place soft below 
SATD	 fixme lose syntactical elements here and others like this 
SATD	 enebo totally weird naming mri not allocated and local var name 
SATD	 fixme this doesnt actually support anything but string 
SATD	 ten stuff into tmp locals load reverse order and assign fixme theres probably slightly smarter way but important 
SATD	 xxx something 
SATD	 todo only setaccessible account for pattern found accessing constants included from nonpublic interface aka being implemented many classes todo not sure need this all since only expose public fields 
SATD	 fixme want eliminate these type casts when possible 
SATD	 hack force clinit created 
SATD	 fixme true array common enough should preallocate and stick somewhere 
SATD	 optional args have irubyobject todo confirm 
SATD	 todo this almost the metaclass perhaps refactor 
SATD	 fixme added this because marshalspec seemed reconstitute objects without calling datawrapstruct this resulted object being null after unmarshalling 
SATD	 todo factor this chunk mriyarv getaster 
SATD	 exit monitor before making call fixme this not being finally little worrisome 
SATD	 self args sss fixme verify that this correct 
SATD	 this for jruby since after suspend the terminal seems need reinitialized since cant easily detect suspension initialize after every readline probably not fast but this for interactive terminals anywayso who cares 
SATD	 todo above but not below for additional newline nodes 
SATD	 sss fixme receiver this the class meta object basically operand receiver 
SATD	 fixme this whole thing could probably implemented module and mixed into appropriate classes especially uses either ioinputoutputstream smart about the kind iolike object its being used against 
SATD	 fixme bit kludge here noninterface classes assigned both class and module fields simplifies proxy extender code will away when overhauled and proxy extenders are deprecated 
SATD	 fixme what should these really numeric assert instanceof rubycomplex instanceof rubycomplex 
SATD	 were depending the side effect the load which loads the class but does not turn into script dont like but until restructure the code bit more well need quietly let here 
SATD	 fixme should also support orgs that use capitalized package names including embarrassingly the one work for but this should enabled system property the expected default behavior for uppercase value should and treat class name and raise exception its not found 
SATD	 todo this version differs from ioctl checking whether fcntl exists and raising notimplemented doesnt perhaps difference for 
SATD	 fixme this temporary since the variable compilers assume want args already stack for assignment just pop and continue with args logic 
SATD	 todo eliminate 
SATD	 todo handle writing into original buffer better 
SATD	 this fairly specific hack for empty string but does the job 
SATD	 xxx this constructor hack implement the end syntax converting reader back into inputstream doesnt generally work 
SATD	 method has more than lines well need split and therefore need use heapbased scope 
SATD	 the implementations these are all bonus see todo above was going throw error from these but appears the wrong place 
SATD	 entry exists proxy doesnt match replace this could happen old proxy was gced todo raise exception stored proxy nonnull not gced 
SATD	 todo better algorithm set precision needed 
SATD	 sss fixme used anywhere dont see calls this anywhere public operand node irscope dasgnnode dasgnnode dasgnnode node dasgnnodegetdepth 
SATD	 todo make this more intelligible value 
SATD	 todo split this into two subclasses that name and constnode can specified seperately 
SATD	 not sure how well this works but works much better than just currenttimemillis itself 
SATD	 fixme this copied code from rubyarray both struct and array should share one impl this also hacky since construct ruby objects access ruby arrays through aref instead something lower 
SATD	 fixme dont like 
SATD	 arguments compilers always create irubyobject but want use rubyarrayconcat here fixme result this not efficient since creates and then later unwraps array 
SATD	 sss fixme what the difference between classvarasgnnode classvardeclnode 
SATD	 fixme set callconfiguration for this 
SATD	 todo readswrites from frame todo information scoping todo visibility 
SATD	 fixme this almost entirely duplicated from mainjava 
SATD	 might need perform dst correction 
SATD	 fixme how much more obtuse can this heredoc already parsed this and saved stringdo not parsejust return 
SATD	 this needs split since conditional calling inherited doesnt fit standard ruby semantics 
SATD	 xxx again screwy evaling under previous frames scope 
SATD	 sss fixme maybe this not really concern after all nesting level this scope the lexical nesting scopes the current file this not confused with semantic nesting scopes across files consider this code file class mmmc end lexical nesting level the file script the file semantically level are this primarily used ensure that variable names dont clash definition closure shouldnt override the use from the parent scope private int lexicalnestinglevel 
SATD	 actual type does not exactly match method return type reget converter fixme when the only autoconversions are primitives this wont needed 
SATD	 fixme should probably still dyncalling write here 
SATD	 fixme finalizer should dupped here 
SATD	 dont bother check final method wont there not generated cant 
SATD	 todo generalize this typechecking code into irubyobject helper 
SATD	 fixme needs rethought 
SATD	 ruby constants for strings should this moved somewhere else 
SATD	 lets only generate methods for those the user may actually intend override that includes any defined the current class and any ancestors that are also javaproxyclasses but none from any other ancestor classes methods defined mixins will considered intentionally overridden except those from kernel java and javaproxymethods well enumerable todo may want exclude other common mixins 
SATD	 fixme dont like the null checks here 
SATD	 invoke callmethodmissing method directly todo this could further optimized since some dsls hit methodmissing pretty hard 
SATD	 todo this really ineffient and potentially problem everytime anyone requires something should try make loadpath special array object 
SATD	 fixme why was this using before that did callsuper 
SATD	 body rescue node inspect its pieces separately avoid disabling all optz todo this gross 
SATD	 fixme this does not have exact same semantics rubyarrayjoin but they probably could consolidated perhaps joinargs sep dochomp 
SATD	 lame generics issues making segment class static and manually inserting cache reference work around various problems generically referencing methodsvars across classes 
SATD	 fixme this determine module strange location and should somehow block 
SATD	 todo think this ends propagating from normal java exceptions 
SATD	 this seems unlikely happen unless its totally bogus fileno even need bother trying create one 
SATD	 todo turn off the negative will return lax mode 
SATD	 todo listsublistfrom toclear supposed clear the sublist from the list how can support this operation 
SATD	 see note below field kludge 
SATD	 were not setting the provider anything but seems that bouncycastle does some internal things its providers constructor which require executed secure context ideally this hack should removed see jruby and this bug 
SATD	 this rather ugly hack but similar mri see hashcrubysetenv and similar mri search all keys for caseinsensitive match and use that 
SATD	 todo wrong get interfaces from class 
SATD	 todo make callcoerced work block contextthen fix downto step and upto 
SATD	 fixme the code below copy rubyioputs and should avoid copypaste 
SATD	 install invokedynamic bootstrapper todo need abstract this setup behind another compiler interface 
SATD	 fixme inefficient constructing bignum just for dumping 
SATD	 todo ruby does not seem care about invalid numeric mode values not sure ruby overflows here also 
SATD	 fixme obvious issue that not all platforms can display all attributes ugly hacks using generic posix library makes pushing inspect behavior into specific system impls rather painful 
SATD	 rbcopygenericivar from dupsetup here unlikely 
SATD	 fixme this really ought clinit but doesnt matter much 
SATD	 using iochannel may not the most performant way but its easy 
SATD	 todo this should entry into error handling somewhere 
SATD	 todo make this specificarity calling 
SATD	 sss fixme what happens the add class this case 
SATD	 sss fixme are guaranteed that splats dont head multipleassignment nodes 
SATD	 todo catch exception constant already set other thread 
SATD	 todo implement tty and isatty have real capability determine this from java but could set tty status then could invoke jruby differently allow stdin return true this this would allow things like cgirb work properly 
SATD	 fixme should getting this from the runtime rather than assume none return 
SATD	 end hack 
SATD	 todo this isnt exact port mris pipe behavior revisit 
SATD	 todo protected methods this going require rework some the mechanism 
SATD	 fixme what should this really assert instanceof rubycomplex 
SATD	 fixme this isnt right for within ensuredrescued code 
SATD	 sss fixme token can final for method implying that the token only for this particular implementation the method but the mehod modified create new method object which turn gets new token what makes sense intuitively seems the first one but let see current code version token for this method can change during execution methods get redefined 
SATD	 todo would nice throw better error for this 
SATD	 set field for the cacheentry todo make this array its not much class metadata similar abstractscript stuff 
SATD	 todo newtypeerror does not offer enough for ruby error string 
SATD	 sss fixme added this this correct 
SATD	 uppercase package name todo toplevel uppercase package was supported the previous rubybased implementation leaving see note future approach below the toplevel 
SATD	 todo wire into new exception handling mechanism 
SATD	 todo this also defined the metaclass tooconsolidate somewhere 
SATD	 fixme constdecl could two seperate classes done differently since constnode and name never exist the same time 
SATD	 todo number formatting here mri uses api must 
SATD	 todo need get this back into the method signaturenow too late 
SATD	 super calls from proxies must use reflected method fixme possible make handles the superclass call 
SATD	 todo better error handling 
SATD	 sss fixme should this operand compoundstring can happen that symbols are built out other than compound strings can happen during optimizations that this becomes generic operand 
SATD	 fixme should really not creating the dynamic scope for the root the ast before parsing this makes end needing readjust this dynamic scope coming out parse and for local static scopes will always happen because and fixme because end adjusting this afterthefact cant use any the specificsize scopes 
SATD	 todo not sure that should skip calling join altogether threadjoin has some implications for java memory model etc 
SATD	 hack get right style for input 
SATD	 variables were added then may need grow the dynamic scope match the static one fixme make this only need check this for blockscope null cannot currently since create the dynamicscope for localstaticscope before parse begins refactoring should make this fixable 
SATD	 sss fixme this method least the context multiple assignment little weird calls regular toary the object but encounters methodmissing the value inserted into element array try abc first then define fixnumtoary method and try again httpgistgithubcom 
SATD	 fixme potentially could just use bytelist here 
SATD	 ignore job was cancelled fixme this 
SATD	 regular division with some default precision todo proper algorithm set the precision 
SATD	 todo exec should replace the current process this could possible with jna 
SATD	 sometimes the value can retrieved compile time succeed nothing like might not for the following reasons the constant missing the reference forwardreference the constants value only known runtime firstaccess but this runtime isnt our compiler isnt able right away infer that this constant sss fixme the operand can literal array range hash hence operand because array range and hash derive from operand and not constant there way fix this impedance mismatch should possible handle the forwardreference case creating new forwardreference operand and then inform the scope the forward reference which the scope can fix when the reference gets defined codegen time the reference unresolved when value retrieved for the forwardref and get null can throw constmissing exception not sure 
SATD	 fixme probably not right here since might eventually want javaarray marshallable jruby 
SATD	 todo this probably bad 
SATD	 fixme really want declared methods includes privateprotected and does not include superclass methods 
SATD	 fixme shouldnt need javaovrdmethods just query locally defined methods 
SATD	 todo call config with scope but frame 
SATD	 todo ruby truncates string specific size here but our bytelist should handle this already 
SATD	 todo clonesetup here 
SATD	 todo must override rubymodule pick constants 
SATD	 todo nonstrict option 
SATD	 todo adjust length wont fall the middle multibyte character mris sprintfc uses tables modified version regexc which assume some particular encoding for given see regexcrembcinit rubyp this only issue the user specifies precision that causes the string truncated the same issue would arise taking substring bytelistbacked rubystring 
SATD	 fixme logic needed 
SATD	 todo note lack commandcom support for win 
SATD	 todo need calculate every time

SATD	 todo pipe handler reopened with path and mode 
SATD	 todo check the return value here 
SATD	 fixme when get jna need properly write this errno 
SATD	 todo other reserved names 
SATD	 todo better detection when path absolute not the path isnt absolute then prepend the current working directory the path 
SATD	 todo deal with varargs 
SATD	 todo store begin and end information into this node 
SATD	 todo ruby locks the string here 
SATD	 todo put these nil guards into tree bigger than want right now

SATD	 sss fixme incomplete 
SATD	 sss fixme pick one bytelist string add internal conversion methods convert the default representation 
SATD	 todo check too many open files and try again 
SATD	 sss fixme cannot optimize this without assuming that rangetoary method has not redefined for now return null 
SATD	 todo this and recacherespondsto needed synchronized for jruby but this degraded performance nearly its still faster than mri but reanalysis this code may show faster way ensure were caching safely 
SATD	 sss fixme done 
SATD	 fixme argconcat logic missing for optcallargs 
SATD	 todo implement wont this now 
SATD	 fixme need detect magiccomment here for encoding 
SATD	 fixme may interning more than once 
SATD	 todo validate port numeric 
SATD	 todo same zerolength checks file above 
SATD	 todo this code should really check ruby equals method implemented not 
SATD	 todo ruby unlocks the string here 
SATD	 not already defined add new that guesses which signature use todo just adding first one right nowadd signatureguessing logic 
SATD	 fixme make thread pool threads daemons necessary 
SATD	 filter out any java primitive names todo should check against all java reserved names here not just primitives 
SATD	 todo can probably release our references the constantfields array and staticinstance callback hashes this point 
SATD	 not clone cached methods fixme mri copies all methods here 
SATD	 todo check safe taint incoming string 
SATD	 todo mri just when node need this extra logic for ide consumers null casenode statement should implicit nil 
SATD	 todo formalize conversion mechanisms between java and ruby 
SATD	 fixme when get jna need properly write this errno

SATD	 always add plugins there not good way compare plugin zips and their extracted contents the moment todo determine the best way derive the filesize and checksum the plugin zip that was last extracted should keep around how about using the current releasexml file come think perhaps shouldnt computing the checksum any existing files why dont just get from the current releasexml file 
SATD	 todo verify this

SATD	 note some dbmss such oracle not allow select rowid from table you cannot have any column name the columns clause you have there aliasing the table name seems the best way get around the problem 
SATD	 are displaying new dataset there was cell editor operation tell cancel how does this impact popup display 
SATD	 kludge want some info about the columns available for validating the user input during cell editing operations ideally would get that info inside the resultsetdataset class during the creation the columndefinition objects using various functions resultsetmetadata such isnullableidx unfortunately least some dbmss postgres hsdb the results those calls are not the same and are less accurate than the call used columnstab get the column info even more unfortunate the fact that the set attributes reported the two calls not the same with the resultsetmetadata listing things not provided getcolumns most the data provided the resultsetmetadata calls correct however the nullablenotnullable property not set correctly least two dbmss while correct for those dbmss the getcolumns info therefore collect the collumn nullability information from getcolumns and pass that info the resultset override what got from the resultsetmetadata 
SATD	 the utility class that reads and writes release info fromto the releasexml file todo springinject when this class spring bean 
SATD	 todo this wont work when the column has values with quotes them use preparedstatements instead hmmm instead insert statements could not just create sequence and generate select statement that uses the sequence for the pkid selects distinct values that would more efficient approach that would also eliminate this quoting problem 
SATD	 the following only works returns and instanceof basemdiparentframe returns and instance dialog frame then other code must used 
SATD	 need somehow call something like panel getpanel however that doesnt apply when the user exporting from the table contents table there needs more generic way this for all tables containing data that exported where some the fields contain placeholders for now just inform the user and let them either continue abort and change the configuration manually rerun the query reload the table data and reexport 
SATD	 split these functions off into subclass basefavouriteaction 
SATD	 todo rename this gettabletype 
SATD	 todo bizarre that couldnt find valid sql drop index 
SATD	 todo dialog handling cancelled 
SATD	 this refactoring depends the following api methods getcreatetablesql 
SATD	 should probably create own table model but being bit slack 
SATD	 todo probably want allow the user set these sequence properties sequence settings 
SATD	 set expected and checksum here since dont have that information for releasexml file todo can httpclient used get the bytesize releasexml can perform this check 
SATD	 here dont completely understand how these types are used all databases and havent yet had time implement support the dialects for them this exclude list will keep these less commonly used types from failing the test also since not all these types appear java and currently support compiling the code base with use the integer values for new types that were introduces java rather than the type constant name 
SATD	 todo delete this class unused 
SATD	 todo find out why kludge for some reason not able get the sheet size correctly always displays with size that causes the subpanels have their scrollbars showing add bit increase the size the panel the scrollbars are not displayed 
SATD	 copied from java doc matcherreplaceall note that backslashes and dollar signs the replacement string may cause the results different than were being treated literal replacement string dollar signs may treated references captured subsequences described above and backslashes are used escape literal characters the replacement string 
SATD	 todo clean this mess load plugins load all plugin jars into class loader 
SATD	 todo subclass these hibernate dialects provide the canpasteto api method hibernatedialect interface private static final dbdialect dbdialect new dbdialect 
SATD	 this weird dont set this the column header doesnt line with the column contents 
SATD	 required otherwise gets too wide 
SATD	 for now use the same renderer everyone else future change this use new instance renderer for this data type 
SATD	 todo delete 
SATD	 this refactoring depends the following dialect api methods getupdatesql 
SATD	 for pointbase type maps pointbase blob and the size isnt valid requires size for blobs then set something reasonably large like the default size size specified thats practically useless 
SATD	 should the data first cloned that the sorting doesnt take place the array that used getvalue todo this must sorting done thread 
SATD	 todo when the earliest version supported add the following line this should help handle some problems with navigation using tab return move through cells 
SATD	 drop constraints before dropping any tables otherwise may drop the child table prior dropping its fks which would error todo this should done the dialects gettabledropsql method for database specific handlingor ignoring this problem 
SATD	 silently ignore what could anyway 
SATD	 this bit hard coded but use scale here some number displays crazy 
SATD	 todo figure out why the selection the root node the object tree undone dont delay seems like some other thread racing set the selected node none when this happens the detail pane for the root node disappears when session first opened when objecttree frame created this really crappy and unreliable way fix this problem but hides the problem for now better understanding the architecture session creation required before proper solution can attempted rmm 
SATD	 todo temporary until sort out better way guidos fix 
SATD	 todo maybe should have checkbox allow the user toggle default value onoff some dbs like treat empty string different default value than null 
SATD	 check the error stream for problem this bit questionable since possible for processes output something stderr but continue processing but without this some problems are not seen bad argument type messages from the process 
SATD	 this hack currently when precision scale have way determine this valid for the actual data the problem comes when the source dbs precisionscale are greater reported greater than the precisionscale the destination this case maximimizes both for the destination causing definition that allows digits the left the decimal trouble without looking the actual data there way tell this valid some cases will others will not for now make the scale approx onehalf the precision accomodate the most digits the left and right the decimal and hopefully that covers the majority cases 
SATD	 desired get fancy and use icons buttons instead text 
SATD	 todo when jdk the earliest jdk supported squirrel then remove the hardcoding the boolean data type 
SATD	 todo this should handled with iterator 
SATD	 work around some utc and daylight saving offsets 
SATD	 there any way check for invalid input valid input includes least any printable character but could also include unprintable characters 
SATD	 todo these should handled with iterator 
SATD	 this logically not sufficent try cope with the problem that there are the following contradictory rules the jdbc api doc this method should called only once per result this method should called only once per result there are more results when the following true getmoreresults getupdatecount getmoreresults returns false dont know have more results only know that isnt result set since called getupdatecount before getmoreresults because would like know the update count the first result might not allowed call getupdatecount again the intersystems cache driver for example always returns the same updatecount simple insert update delete statements not matter getmoreresults was called updatecount never gets and this will loop forever when discussed the issue with the intersystems people they just told not call getupdatecount twice that simple hope that this will cure problems with dbs that just dont care for multiple result sets 
SATD	 the call here the result desperate fight find place where the components the split had not height someone knows better way please tell ill apreciate any advice 
SATD	 todo springinject when this class spring bean 
SATD	 todo what really want here get the sql script and replace create procedure with alter procedure then put that the sql pane and not execute 
SATD	 todo should adding quotes user wants identifiers quoted 
SATD	 the following ugly conversion from text byte necessary because the byte class inconsistant when asked output hex does unsigned byte but when asked read back the same thing using the hex radix insists that the input must signed get around this upsize the conversion integer then truncate that byte and finally convert the byte byte yech 
SATD	 this should just bring back one table hope 
SATD	 todo temporary until sort out better way guidos fix iquerytokenizer 
SATD	 hack deal with firebirds rdb meta tables 
SATD	 hack deal with axion axion tables 
SATD	 handle mouse events for doubleclick creation popup dialog this happens only the jtextfield not the jtextarea can make this inner class within this method rather than separate inner class done with the keytexthandler class 
SATD	 dont use tinyint for now even though mckoi supports its notion tinyint bit not bit not compatible with other dbs and leads overflow resulting negative values which are corruption the actual value insertedupdated this not great workaround filed bug report the mailing list hopefully will get fixed soon 
SATD	 todo need define better approach getting dialects that dont really want ever prompt the user this case its always oracle yet may have new oracledialect some point 
SATD	 appropriate datatype for this column the best can with what know this may not the best behavior here 
SATD	 evil hack split the vacuum output little 
SATD	 this codeicommandcode displays dialog box that allows the user enter where clause order clause used when getting data via the contents tab author hammela todo change name 
SATD	 todo col add method databasemetadata that returns array objects for for postgresql put this kludge the new function this way all the kludges are kept one place kludge for some dbs postgresql there actually pseudocolumn providing the rowid but the function not implemented this kludge hardcodes the knowledge that specific dbs use specific pseudocolumn additionally you must create the table using with oid appended the create statement otherwise oid column not available default 
SATD	 this workaround for what looks like bug syntax error qualify with the schema the new table name but not the old alter table rename the second public apparently not currently valid thing 
SATD	 skip formatting for stored procedures they can have comments embedded them and presently not sure how the formatter handles this 
SATD	 need tell object display itself panel 
SATD	 all the following have been converted use the datatype objects why not just have case typesnull and default this seems pointless rmm 
SATD	 need associate panel with object type somehow 
SATD	 implement interface and interface todo this code was copied from contentstab should probably put into common location and shared both this class and contentstab 
SATD	 todo how let the user customize this 
SATD	 cse moved this code down here fix repaint problems first display bounds should set before install uninstall the old popup from root pane and install the new one even case they are the same objects its necessary cover the workspace switches etc 
SATD	 todo rename 
SATD	 discovered that the loginame field can null that case how know have the correct view 
SATD	 todo this shouldnt public its only been done for the jcomplete plugin some stage this method will returned package visibility 
SATD	 some dbs like mckoi make the default for scale apply the same hack above 
SATD	 todo move ioutilities see filewrapper 
SATD	 todo work out why kludge for some reason not able get the sheet size correctly always displays with size that causes the subpanels have their scrollbars showing add bit increase the size the panel the scrollbars are not displayed 
SATD	 sql executing produced warnings then write them out the session message handler todo this pain postgresql sends raise notice messages the connection not the statment they will mixed with warnings from other statements 
SATD	 best guess read object this probably the wrong thing here but dont know what else try 
SATD	 hack deal with ingres iie meta tables 
SATD	 this bit hard coded but use scale here some number displays crazy 
SATD	 todo spatial and fulltext indexes require myisam engine for the table there way tell what engine being used for table may not necessary since the following doenst hurt already myisam engine alter table mytable engine myisam still this not the kind thing would want automatically since myisam engine nontransactional will probably need tell the user somehow that they need this otherwise the create index statement will fail maybe comment the script and they happen read they could uncomment the conversion the engine maybe custom dialog

SATD	 jason make menu smarter when second window for the same session added create hierarchical menu for all windows for the session 
SATD	 for some reason when the oracle plugin adds details tabs for triggers the tabpnls first tab ends being the trigger details tab and not the generic database object info tab this causes the tabs length tab greater than the tabs that are actually the tabpnl this throws off the selection such that the tab selected the tab panel doesnt get rendered until the tab the right the selected tab selected this workaround for this problem until can determine why the never makes into the tabpnl the first place 
SATD	 the following workaround for the problem mac where the apple laf delegates the swing popup factory but then tries set alpha the underlying cocoa window which will always null youre using jgoodies see this has effect linuxwindows 
SATD	 coldefs not same order search for matching coldef entry note linear search here will normally not too bad because most tables not have huge numbers columns 
SATD	 todo what about these viewportfont colorchooserfont internalframefont optionpanefont panelfont scrollpanefont desktopiconfont 
SATD	 dont use real type axion sets the column size default yet can handle more precision data being copied from the real column can potentially larger than what the column claims support this will problem for other databases that pay attention the column size todo perhaps reintroduce the real type but use the new getprecisiondigits max out the precision 
SATD	 this info merely placeholder the tree that can use get index name and parent name more easily probably should create indexcolumninfo that has this extra info 
SATD	 todo should the constraint name simply the column name something more like constraint name 
SATD	 some tables have pseudo column primary keys and others not jdbc some dbmss does not handle pseudo columns correctly also gettables returns views well tables the thing are looking might not table jdbc does not give simple way determine what are looking since the type object described dbmsspecific encoding for these reasons rather than testing for all these conditions just try using the pseudo column info get the table data and that fails try get the table data without using the pseudo column todo should change the mode from editable noneditable 
SATD	 todo maybe instead throwing exception could ask the user they would like adjust their preference for them 
SATD	 hack some dbs like frontbase dont support boolean types ive tried tinyint bit and boolean the column type and setboolean fails for all three its mystery this point what column the methods actually work iin frontbase 
SATD	 workaround for this driver which must have dbo for schema the jconnect family drivers appears not affected and can accept null schema which necessary find tables other schemas within the same catalog similarly jtds doesnt require this yet doesnt return nondbo schema tables unfortunately 
SATD	 dialect delegate for the progress database todo progress specification says that the sum all column lengths table row may not exceed need add interface method the hibernatedialect interface that takes array lengths and and checks the sum columns for row this maximum number may different across databases this check method needs implemented each dialect author manningr 
SATD	 todo decide whether this should bound property not name name 
SATD	 endkludge 
SATD	 hack deal with sybases sys tables 
SATD	 todo move all code other than for window creation aliaswindowmanager factory handle creation maintenance sheets for sql alias objects author bella 
SATD	 todo why shouldnt call registersqldriver here rmm 
SATD	 todo should have session listeners instead these calls 
SATD	 todo just noticed that mysql supports multibit bit column using the getobjectsetobject methods with byte would valuable some point make this code bit more dbmsspecific 
SATD	 todo move all code other than for window creation aliaswindowmanager factory handle creation maintenance sheets for sql driver objects author bella 
SATD	 win mnemonics are normally hidden make them visible you press the alt key under the windows pressing alt may not work this code workaround see bug report for more information 
SATD	 todo once were happy that jfcutilities longer required 
SATD	 workaround for bug which means must use dbo for schema 
SATD	 unfortunately need remove the exising tree table component and create new one due limitations with replacing models the existing sun implementation why earth they couldnt formalise the tree table example jfc which use bit more anyones guess 
SATD	 todo figure out why bind variables arent working 
SATD	 todo make properties file can use class name generate properties file name 
SATD	 hack hopefully the name will always the last token 
SATD	 todo need have generic hibernate dialect extend this provide the types 
SATD	 this could perhaps more elegantly done recursion 
SATD	 todo get rid this class this combobox contains all the columns sql table author bella 
SATD	 todo make parameter implement sqlitem interface which has getstring method which can also implemented sqlstring sqlfragment some such can then eliminate the use instanceof below and clean the code bit making itemsinsql look like arraylistsqlitem itemsinsql new arraylistsqlitem 
SATD	 uses java classes that implement the trigger interface operate database tables rows when action triggers them therefore there currently way access the source for trigger hopefully this will change some point the future new triggersourcetabthe source the trigger 
SATD	 arrays strings are special case xmlbeanwriter method processproperty array strings turned into list stringwrapper objects the xml presumably that when reading them back have class that can call setters thus when reading back array strings actually read array stringwrappers which gives type mismatch the following arraycopy therefore need convert the data that currently the stringwrapper objects into actual strings 
SATD	 todo move this ioutilities extracts the specified zip file the specified output directory param zipfile param outputdirectory throws ioexception 
SATD	 set the password for this alias param password the new password throws validationexception todo what conditions 
SATD	 tell caller that the underlying data was not updated this always true could the data updated with warning 
SATD	 empty string seems represented null some drivers not sure this the best thing here but fixes issue where sql returns set default when already null 
SATD	 todo pass message handler user gets error msgs 
SATD	 facade methods for imessagehandler dont want allow code directly access internal imessagehandler now that the imessagehandler interface requires exceptionformatter injected for methods that accept exceptions 
SATD	 jason mow that multiple object trees exist storing the edit where objectinfo within session wont work needs objectinfo within something else private final map editwherecolssheets new hashmap 
SATD	 todo put all the property accessors 
SATD	 delete worked correctly now delete from table important the user and the creator both work through the sortabletablemodel not the actual model thus the row indexes delete are given the sortabletablemodel row numbers must work through that model model actually the delete 
SATD	 todo figure out more reliable way handle other type which indicates databasespecific type 
SATD	 todo giving constraint name universally supported and done the same way every database 
SATD	 todo sort the list 
SATD	 remember which column the rowid any can prevent editing 
SATD	 todo plugin supports only the main session window 
SATD	 called when app shutdown todo put throws clause back 
SATD	 todo 
SATD	 todo tooltips 
SATD	 todo fillfactor primary etc 
SATD	 todo allow the user specify ignore case preserve case 
SATD	 todo when message are can have some text red error and some normal then put out errors red 
SATD	 todo tell the user that the selected destination schema the same the source schema 
SATD	 todo primary 
SATD	 todo maybe prompt the user ask append the records ignoring errors for constraint violations 
SATD	 todo refresh 
SATD	 todo maybe someday could inform the user that the imported key cant created because the list tables theyve selected doesnt include the table that this foreign key depends upon for now just log warning and skip 
SATD	 todo hookup with interbase spec and adjust these necessary 
SATD	 todo figure out how get then name the table that the trigger and tablesname 
SATD	 todo should also make sure that each the columns made not null 
SATD	 not implemented 
SATD	 sorts the specified destinfos array based the order the sourceinfos array not very efficient algorthim but gets the job done todo rewrite this using collections sorting capability param sourceinfos param destinfos param sourcetablename param desttablename return reordered version the specified destinfos array throws mappingexception the arrays differ length column names 
SATD	 todo perhaps can tell the user when they click copy table the source session axion and they want primary keys that its not possible 
SATD	 todo use the destination database type derive format that acceptable 
SATD	 todo the use checks export entire table and doesnt select all then the selected indices are not set and this check doesnt properly detect missing data export entire table selected need set the selected indexes below correctly 
SATD	 todo create the child index 
SATD	 just copied the last table now safe copy the constraintswell that all dependencies are met the group tables being copied todo new feature could examine table list for fks tables not the list then prompt the user add those missing tables the list 
SATD	 dialect delegate for the axion database todo this dialect not yet complete need provide implementations wherever not yet implemented appears 
SATD	 todo allow the user specify the sequence name for dialects that dont natively support autoincrement columns without using sequencetrigger combo 
SATD	 todo finish 
SATD	 todo need enhance the index dialog allow specifying storage option for now just accept the default for the index access method using btree 
SATD	 todo put throws clause back empty method 
SATD	 todo should also have the type string date 
SATD	 todo need add storageoptions the add index dialog 
SATD	 move any files that are located the core downloads dir the downloads dir the spring application context will not load properly for some unknown reason when there are jars the classpath workaround simply ensure that they are where they should anyway previously were not careful about this possible that jars were copied into the core downloads directory 
SATD	 todo implement this better 
SATD	 todo need implement change the message 
SATD	 todo need allow user specify this 
SATD	 dialect delegate for the timesten database todo this dialect not yet complete need provide implementations wherever not yet implemented appears 
SATD	 dialect delegate for the sun microsystems hadb highavailability database todo this dialect not yet complete need provide implementations wherever not yet implemented appears author manningr 
SATD	 not yet ready tab new return new tab 
SATD	 todo set the total for the progress bar 
SATD	 todo use the destination database type derive format that acceptable 
SATD	 future may want create tablepopupmenu allow cutcopypaste operations 
SATD	 todo ask the user they want undo the changes that the paste made alternatively show them the specific problem and let them fix then allow them retry the operation starting from the point which the previous operation failed

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 component glue boxcreateglue cgridx cgridy paneladdglue 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 rows updated 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dbname the sessions url set but the sessions current catalog set nnsql server doesnt support this most cases this current issue 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the constructor above sets this from resources but well override with the name the database file and its size 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 because the crosscatalog problem lets not invoke this the current catalog isnt equal the catalog specified the url 
SATD	 todo exception 
SATD	 the parameters the test service query need with the providermerge 
SATD	 should not override 
SATD	 important for async scenario must remove context from current thread always create new rpccontext for the next invoke for the same thread 
SATD	 todo move somewhere else better 
SATD	 the parameters the provider for the inspection service need merge 
SATD	 fixme now need check first then load 
SATD	 todo contextsessions the best option here jetty becomes 
SATD	 todo move names constants 
SATD	 ignore concurrent problem 
SATD	 todo add this provider config 
SATD	 service not found 
SATD	 special treatment array values was suggested lizongbo 
SATD	 todo should leave this setting slfj 
SATD	 fixme when the thread pool full cannot return properly therefore the consumer side has wait until gets timeout this temporary solution prevent this scenario from happening but better solution should considered later 
SATD	 the initial value null and the midway may assigned null please use the local variable reference 
SATD	 request nonexists method 
SATD	 fixme requestcontext 
SATD	 duplicated jar found 
SATD	 possible here 
SATD	 for example object transported the wire doesnt implement serializable 
SATD	 bug dubbo 
SATD	 fixme log error message codec and handle caught iohanndler 
SATD	 there may some problem handling chinese negative number recognition ignoring this problem the backspace key only meaningfully input real telnet program 
SATD	 this unstable consider remove later see 
SATD	 biz error should not throw and affect biz thread 
SATD	 bug dubbo 
SATD	 todo more sophisticated exception handling and output 
SATD	 todo for now kryo serialization doesnt deny classes that dont implement the serializable interface pre ltdubboprotocol serializationkryo pre 
SATD	 delimstart was escaped thus should not incremented 
SATD	 todo users can override this mapper but just rely the current priority strategy resteasy 
SATD	 fixme waiting for embedded nacos suport then can open the switch 
SATD	 todo generic invoker 
SATD	 whether the consumers machine has only one process multiple processes the same machine cannot unicast with unicast there will only one process receiving information 
SATD	 fixme this instance will always type configcenterconfig will load the instance startup and assign here 
SATD	 todo not want use spaces see dubbo url class handles special conventions for special characters 
SATD	 should destroy resource 
SATD	 hack use reflection get the shared channel 
SATD	 todo notification failure does not restore mechanism guarantee 
SATD	 todo fix npe 
SATD	 todo needs use force writing file that buffer gets clear and new log can written 
SATD	 note should determined the business level whether the when condition can empty not 
SATD	 reselect before retry avoid change candidate invokers note invokers changed then invoked also lose accuracy 
SATD	 todo load spi will better 
SATD	 fixme reject exception can not sent consumer because thread pool full resulting consumers waiting till timeout 
SATD	 todo refactor using mockito 
SATD	 generally client can only closed once here closed twice counter incorrect 
SATD	 todo temporary solution the problem that the exception information can not sent the opposite end after the thread pool full need refactoring fix the thread pool full refuses call does not return and causes the consumer wait for time out 
SATD	 todo the future maybe can just use single rest client and connection manager 
SATD	 caution 
SATD	 todo solve merge problem 
SATD	 fixme hack make work 
SATD	 the buffer big enough 
SATD	 bug dubbo version config retryfalse providers method doesnt work 
SATD	 fixme this exposes the design flaw routerchain 
SATD	 fixme responsecontext 
SATD	 todo jetty will default enable keepalive the xml config has effect now 
SATD	 cannot write not available 
SATD	 todo wrapper cannot handle this scenario correctly the classname contains 
SATD	 server side thrift can not handle exceptions not declared idl 
SATD	 todo assert error log 
SATD	 this class represents unfinished rpc call will hold some context information for this call for example rpccontext and invocation that when the call finishes and the result returns can guarantee all the contexts being recovered the same when the call was made before any callback invoked todo its reasonable even right keep reference invocation link result implements completionstage link asyncrpcresult allows you easily build async filter chain whose status will driven entirely the state the underlying rpc call asyncrpcresult does not contain any concrete value except the underlying value bring completablefuture consider status transfer node link getvalue and link getexception are all inherited from link result interface implementing them are mainly for compatibility consideration because many legacy link filter implementation are most possibly call getvalue directly 
SATD	 fixme should put exception future 
SATD	 dubbo methods key providers urlone doesnt contain the methods from inherited super interface 
SATD	 todo need enhance assertion 
SATD	 fixme this code looks useless 
SATD	 todo due dubbos current architecture will called from registry protocol the shutdown process and wont appear logs 
SATD	 todo can load successfully for different classloader 
SATD	 the status input has problem and the read information wrong when the serialization serialized 
SATD	 fixme not sure why has both isgeneric and getgeneric 
SATD	 fixme result asyncrpcresult instance 
SATD	 fixme should cancel and restart timer tasks parameters the new url are different 
SATD	 todo extract more code here necessary 
SATD	 fixme rmi protocol doesnt support casting echoservice yet 
SATD	 dubbos original impl cant support the use servletcontext 
SATD	 deprecated subscribe override rules before 
SATD	 subscribe the override data fixme when the provider subscribes will affect the scene certain jvm exposes the service and call the same service because the subscribed cached key with the name the service causes the 
SATD	 should called after config was fully initialized fixme this method should completely replaced appendparameters return see object string notice this method should include all properties the returning map treat parameter differently compared appendparameters 
SATD	 todo can the value returned getchannel null need improvement 
SATD	 todo support wildcards 
SATD	 fixme cannot guarantee the sequence the merge result check implementation 
SATD	 fixme there any need failing back constantsanyvalue the first available method invokers when invokers null 
SATD	 synchronized save the file 
SATD	 todo more configs add 
SATD	 bug dubbo provider doesnt have exception output and consumer has timeout error when serialization fails 
SATD	 fixme theres place release connectionexecutor 
SATD	 todo refactor 
SATD	 every invoker has the same weight 
SATD	 todo this may not pretty elegant solution 
SATD	 fixme log error info codec and put all error handle logic iohanndler 
SATD	 issue springstatuschecker execute errors nonxml spring configuration issue ignore 
SATD	 cant shutdown nioeventloopgroup because the method will invoked when closing one channel but not client but when and how close the nioeventloopgroup 
SATD	 fixme this really necessary should have already covered this see see 
SATD	 the resident routers must being initialized before address notification fixme this method should not public 
SATD	 todo there may have duplicate refresh 
SATD	 fixme replace this with better method 
SATD	 todo for now dont consider the differences encoding and server limit 
SATD	 fixme check and any conditions that need match 
SATD	 rmi needs extra parameter since uses customized remote invocation object the customized remoteinvocation was firstly introduced the package was renamed orgapache since considering the above two conditions need check before sending customized remoteinvocation the provider version higher send the provider version higher send the provider version lower than does not use customized remoteinvocation 
SATD	 reference should not null and the implementation the given interface 
SATD	 todo exist concurrent gap 
SATD	 todo fixme the thread pool should used refresh the address otherwise the task may accumulated 
SATD	 theres dynamic tag rule being set use static tag url typical scenario consumer using version calls providers using version lower the consumer should always respect the tag provider url regardless whether dynamic tag rule has been set not todo guarantee consistent behavior interoperability between and this method should has the same logic with the tagrouter param invokers param url param invocation param return 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo add this provider config

SATD	 todo need track symbol strip tool 
SATD	 return dummy implementation this creating real hasher drags more services along with and hasher isnt actually needed the worker process side the moment 
SATD	 theres risk for some methods that the hash always recomputed but wont worse than before 
SATD	 this isnt quite right should close the worker classpath cache once were finished with the worker processes this may before the end this build they may used across multiple builds 
SATD	 todo need better mechanism wire tasks into lifecycle 
SATD	 todocedric this not quite right assume that are asking for specific binary then resolve the assembly instead the jar but should somehow parameterized 
SATD	 ensure that most one action that may have access the mutable state the build runs given time todo move this better home and reuse

SATD	 passing null for sha todo consider using the etag which hash the file when less than 
SATD	 todoadam need this earlier 
SATD	 todo add deprecation warning gradle 
SATD	 todo exception when default type 
SATD	 result scalautileither right seq files that were generated left routes compilation errors todo might nice pass along these errors some way 
SATD	 todo deleteonexit wont clean nonempty directories and leaks memory for longrunning processes 
SATD	 metainfo about java component todo this some legacy stuff merged into other component interfaces 
SATD	 todo need track symbol extraction tool 
SATD	 todo this should modeled differently perhaps dependency the implementation configuration 
SATD	 this not super nice but dependencies are created through reflection for decoration and assume constructor with arguments group name version which suitable for most cases could create empty attribute set directly the but then wouldnt mutable therefore proceed with late injection the attributes 
SATD	 todo should split this that the inputs are attached object that represents the binary which then later used configure the linkassemble tasks 
SATD	 need wrap this into loop because theres always risk that the method which weakly referenced has been collected between the creation time and now 
SATD	 tododaniel should support better way multi file invocation 
SATD	 todo dont select again here the selection already performed select the toolchain 
SATD	 todo include link documentation giving more explanation whats going here 
SATD	 should this null 
SATD	 todo migrate this away from here 
SATD	 todo deal with more than one directory 
SATD	 this looks ugly very ugly but that apparently what ant does itself 
SATD	 todo should incremental 
SATD	 was updated during execution 
SATD	 todo this terrible 
SATD	 todo this should actually routable message with single handler but need some way correlate given request with specific response channel 
SATD	 todo this pretty nasty look avoiding using time bomb stub here 
SATD	 todo better exception type 
SATD	 note this would better housed scope that encapsulated the tree gradle objects 
SATD	 sane enough 
SATD	 todo publishing for test executable 
SATD	 link that can used task input property caches the matching set files during task execution and discards the result after task execution todo disallow further changes this collection once task has started todo keep the file entries snapshot later avoid stat each file during snapshot 
SATD	 todo this class and executionplan have many the same behavior and concerns should look for way generalize this pattern 
SATD	 remove this 
SATD	 this isnt quite right may lose precision when converting double 
SATD	 decimalformat not thread safe synchronize access the instance 
SATD	 todo wire this stuff properly 
SATD	 todoadam need cleanup completion too not used 
SATD	 todo need check for proper typecast 
SATD	 todo should use resolver that this method consistent with projecturistring 
SATD	 todo wolfs schedule fingerprinting separately can done without having the project lock 
SATD	 todo consider issues teamcity has the concept wave messages where each threadprocess uses unique wave 
SATD	 todo reduce duplication with swift binary 
SATD	 are all file snapshots after execution accounted for new entries 
SATD	 todo move bootclasspath platform 
SATD	 todo this should modeled source set 
SATD	 todo the project model should reachable from projectstate without another lookup 
SATD	 todo locate this tool from tool provider hide main symbol 
SATD	 todo this prefix shouldnt hardcoded 
SATD	 todolptr remove projection for reference node this shouldnt needed but theres actual value referenced model report can only show the type the node this for now should use the schema instead find the type the property node instead 
SATD	 todo add test name the report formatteroff 
SATD	 todoadam switch the logging back need make sending messages from daemon client async wrt log event generation loggerdebugignoring failure extract throwable stack trace ignored 
SATD	 todo need failure handling cannot clone repository 
SATD	 todo this should actually compare sortedset 
SATD	 todo validate that its valid model path 
SATD	 the visual tools use the path find other executables todoadam restrict this the specific path for the target tool 
SATD	 todopm move this warn level once fixed mavenpublish see gradlegradle 
SATD	 todoadam this isnt quite right think refers the first capable classloader loading the class this could different from the loader which originally loaded which could pose equality and lifecycle issues 
SATD	 immutable view the variant component todo this should replace merge into outgoingvariant 
SATD	 because its capability conflict resolution there only one candidate per module identifier can lenient wrt the version number used the descriptor which helps whenever the user used the convenience notation method 
SATD	 todo improve lookup reusing availablejavahomes testfixture for now play safe and just return false 
SATD	 task properties 
SATD	 todo should decorate 
SATD	 todo removing this stuff from the store should handled through some sort decoration 
SATD	 todo need any factories here 
SATD	 todohh this should moved back into languagenative project 
SATD	 todo make this work with pending elements 
SATD	 todo these should come from somewhere else probably 
SATD	 todo this should become smarter and move into the compiler infrastructure instead the task similar how the other native languages are done for now this does rudimentary incremental build analysis looking which files changed 
SATD	 minimal resolver which does not use any native services used during bootstrap only you should generally use link fileresolver instead todo share more stuff with 
SATD	 list instance needed here does not support serializing iterators directly 
SATD	 todolptr this should added only the scan plugin applied but todolptr expects added also when the build cache enabled but not the scan plugin 
SATD	 todo does static library really have any runtime elements 
SATD	 todo should set this for macos but this currently breaks xctest support for swift when swift depends libraries built gradle 
SATD	 todo provide abstraction for accessing resources within the same module mavenmetadata directory listing etc that way can avoid passing ivypatterns and artifactpatterns around everywhere 
SATD	 closes the tooling api releasing all resources blocks until completed pmay attempt expire some all daemons started this tooling api client the exact behaviour here and not guaranteed the expiration best effort only this method may return before the daemons have stoppedp pnote this not yet part the public tooling api yetp todo need model this long running operation and allow stdout stderr and progress listener supplied todo need define exceptions todo further operations are allowed after this has been called todo cancel current operations block until complete todo introduce tooling api client interface and move this method there 
SATD	 todo use something more stable than cast here 
SATD	 todo make this more intelligent matching the attributes the runtime usage the variant identities 
SATD	 workaround for backwards compatibility previously this case would unintentionally cause the method invoked the owner continue below 
SATD	 todo capitalise the target name the task name todo dont create launch target for library 
SATD	 possible that multiple threads will execute this branch concurrently when the type missing however the contract for get below will ensure that only one thread will actually generate the implementation class 
SATD	 create binaries for test suites todo this should really componentbinaries rule but this point have clue what the concrete binary type everything has duplicated specific plugins see usages for example 
SATD	 did already consider output after the previous execution 
SATD	 not valid signature 
SATD	 todo should iterate over each candidate until successfully copy into the cache 
SATD	 todo replace with native test task 
SATD	 todo get rid this need functionalsourceset instance here and thats surprisingly difficult get 
SATD	 todo generic model related super exception 
SATD	 todo this should work for any build rather than just included build 
SATD	 workaround for 
SATD	 todo versionselector should more descriptive can directly translated 
SATD	 todolptr should contentless inputdirectory 
SATD	 todo need smarter way map usage artifact classifier 
SATD	 todo once source compatibility raised this should rewritten using the javaniofilesystem api which can deal with jars and folders the same way instead duplicating code 
SATD	 todo better exception 
SATD	 todo this method accepts closure instance parameter but does not work correctly for 
SATD	 todo find better way present this information the error message attempt mimic gradle nested exception output 
SATD	 todo should really find better solution for this maybe could use filterreader instead filterinputstream 
SATD	 need perform the actual resolve 
SATD	 not fully accurate but sensible fallback see 
SATD	 todo not sure can clean the generics here and less unchecked casting 
SATD	 should use instantiatorfactory instead pick some validation but this currently somewhat expensive 
SATD	 todo add other build like files buildgradlekts settingsgradlekts other gradle gradleproperties 
SATD	 todo deal with more than one header dir generated public headers 
SATD	 todo projectdependency should transformed based defaultproject and other context elsewhere 
SATD	 todo validations method synthetic bridge methods varargs abstract native 
SATD	 todo this will have changed when support setting credentials directly the authentication 
SATD	 todo this approximation know swift currently supports only bit runtimes eventually well want query for this 
SATD	 todo the async work tracker should wait for children operation finish first should not necessary call here 
SATD	 todo reduce duplication with binary 
SATD	 todo this should more specific just the tasks that create the class files 
SATD	 todo arent considering the filter 
SATD	 todo exception when type cannot created 
SATD	 todo bind with the sourcecompatibility property todo link runtime configuration 
SATD	 track this input since the scala compiler output may depend todo this should replaced property the scala toolchain soon model these 
SATD	 todolptr instead the first view property should figure out these parameters from the actual property 
SATD	 todo dsl documentation 
SATD	 todo can probably now support more versions with strictly but well need more test coverage 
SATD	 todo move this objectfactory 
SATD	 there are some exceptions attached the suite lets make sure they are reported the user this may happen for example when suite initialisation fails and tests are executed 
SATD	 todo does static library have runtime elements 
SATD	 todolptr remove projection for reference node this shouldnt needed but theres actual value referenced model report can only show the type the node this for now should use the schema instead find 
SATD	 todo what this errors 
SATD	 remove this 
SATD	 todo remove this special case 
SATD	 doesnt really make sense 
SATD	 todo exceptions thrown here should point some extensive documentation the concept class rule sources 
SATD	 todo move this base plugin setup the dependency the main binary this should all replaced single dependency that points some testable variants the main binary 
SATD	 todo should support this adds void propnameobject value method that simply delegates the converting setter method 
SATD	 todo send message workers change their log level rather than stopping 
SATD	 todo this should also using the decorating instantiator but cannot for backwards compatibility 
SATD	 todo visit the contents this collection instead this just super simple implementation for now 
SATD	 todo should get rid this reflection will need reimplement the parser act the metadata directly 
SATD	 todo want keep using sourcedirectoryset the new api would feel more natural dirs could added directly languagesourceset could also think about extending sourcedirectoryset 
SATD	 todo stream serialised value file todo handle hash collisions properly this time todo dont store null links child blocks leaf index blocks todo align block boundaries todo thread safety control todo merge small values into single data block todo discard when file corrupt todo include data directly index entry when serializer can guarantee small fixed sized data todo free list leaks disk space todo merge adjacent free blocks todo use more efficient lookup for free block with nearest size 
SATD	 todo binaries arent input this rule theyre input the action 
SATD	 specifies how build and where place native executable file ptodohh resolve naming conflict with existing 
SATD	 this should replaced some stronger modelling and made open rather than hardcoding set source languages here 
SATD	 moved the api back into internal this isnt really correct 
SATD	 todo refactor this action out can unit tested 
SATD	 todo error there are unknowns 
SATD	 not sure this required its the parent already 
SATD	 todoadam using uuid means create classloader hierarchy for each daemon process talk instead use the spec decide whether reuse classloader 
SATD	 should never get here the last strategy should catch all 
SATD	 todo should supply and check for the same parameters passed reservenewclient 
SATD	 todo should use the install task for executable 
SATD	 implement this you need specify individual toolchains via 
SATD	 todo annotate required 
SATD	 project involved need aware 
SATD	 production code should handle these exceptions more gracefully 
SATD	 ignore deal with this problem later 
SATD	 todo this isnt quite right 
SATD	 the isempty check not required might look innocent but guavas performance bad for empty immutable list because still creates inner class for iterator which delegates array iterator which does nothing just adding this check has significant impact because most components not declare any capability 
SATD	 todo add quotes both formats there will lots tests failing not sure worth 
SATD	 todoew consider whether this belongs buildprogressarea here 
SATD	 todo would better these were added via separate managed view rather than hard coded 
SATD	 shouldnt really here currently this goal used link bindallreferences which also expects the subject bound 
SATD	 this doesnt work used because the bottom the hierarchy chain the object implemented methodmissing however our normal decorated classes not this not realistic 
SATD	 have isgetter well getgetter 
SATD	 todo this returns the wrong public type for domain objects created with the eager apis added directly the container this can leak internal types not currently keep track the type used when creating domain object via create the type the container when domain object added directly via add 
SATD	 todolptr what happens when the property has multiple accessors the same role but with different type 
SATD	 todo this should container platforms 
SATD	 dont really need handle this 
SATD	 todo hack avoid classloading issues should use currently cant use reliably because causes cnf issues with cross version integration tests running against tooling api 
SATD	 todo else verify that the build definition the same 
SATD	 todo make this lazy 
SATD	 todo should this take object 
SATD	 used the kotlindsl base plugin todo remove this 
SATD	 have name foobar and import foofoo this means foobar possibly foofoobar rather than foobar this means cut the dot foobar and foo for import 
SATD	 todo remove this once the above removed 
SATD	 todo only here because kotlin dsl uses this please remove once that fixed 
SATD	 hold the lock while creating the connection not generally good form this instance blocks other threads from creating the connection the same time 
SATD	 currently retains strong references types that are not loaded using this fine for jvm types but problem when custom classloader used which should probably deprecated instead supported 
SATD	 might fail hard here the assumption that something weird happened the daemon however since havent yet started running the build can recover just trying again 
SATD	 todo improve configuration reports 
SATD	 keep the files and discard the origin values instead 
SATD	 todo turn into set 
SATD	 theres potential problem here that reads from input the background this wont automatically stop when the process over therefore input not closed then this thread will run forever would better ensure that this thread stops when the process does 
SATD	 todo need better job routing messages when there are multiple endpoints this just going forward all queued messages the first waiting endpoint even there are multiple waiting work 
SATD	 create test suite component todo reuse logic from swiftplugin todo component name and extension name arent the same todo should use srcxctestswift the convention add the test suite and extension 
SATD	 not use this its here because some the services this type needs are not easily accessed certain cases and will removed some point use one the other methods instead 
SATD	 todo figure out how get rid origin scope snapshot outputs step 
SATD	 get rid the ivy token are not valid uri characters 
SATD	 todo remove this property once configuration can handle normal file system dependencies 
SATD	 this piece ugliness copies the jaxp xml api provider any from the system classloader heres why when looking for provider jaxp looks for service resource the context classloader which our isolated classloader our classpath above does not contain provider this returns null does contain provider jaxp extracts the classname from the service resource not found jaxp looks for service resource the system classloader this happens include all the application classes specified the classpath the application classpath does not contain provider this returns null does contain provider jaxp extracts the implementation classname from the service resource not found jaxp uses default classname jaxp attempts load the provider using the context classloader which our isolated classloader this fine the classname came from step blows the classname came from step workaround locate and make visible xml parser classes from the system classloader our isolated classloader note that practise this only triggered when running our tests 
SATD	 todo will implemented without hardcoded access for 
SATD	 todo this hardcodes the assumption compile configuration the external module instead should creating api configuration for each resolved module 
SATD	 this legacy quirk scans use this determine that progress logging indicating startfinish tasks this can removed gradle along with the concept logging category operation 
SATD	 see the comment taskcompleted above for why this here and why this problem 
SATD	 todo the special casing virtual platform should away can implement disambiguation variants for single component 
SATD	 todo this should actually extend from the api dependencies but since swift currently requires all dependencies treated like api dependencies with transitivity just use the implementation dependencies here see 
SATD	 todo replace this with jvmassembly once that type public 
SATD	 this not very nice might good enough until get rid and friends avoid traversing the graph causing the full resolveddependency graph loaded for the most typical scenario 
SATD	 not implemented not yet required please implement required 
SATD	 todo extract the nonfilesystem parts the into separate interface this isnt really tied file system watching just need another type waiter 
SATD	 todo this class sources gradle metadata files but theres corresponding for this metadata yet because this will generate empty instance either ivy maven based the repository type 
SATD	 todo this isnt correct assumes that side effect add the element 
SATD	 todo classes should little more tied the classesdirs for sourceset every plugin doesnt need this 
SATD	 this really not cool but cannot rely readattributes because will throw exception the file missing which really incredibly slow just determine file exists not 
SATD	 todo use twirl library instead 
SATD	 not use this constructor directly its only there for backwards compatibility with the nebula plugin 
SATD	 groovy does something very strange here for some reason probably because the class java wont employ any dynamism even implementing invokemethod the java level has effect 
SATD	 todo change set 
SATD	 tododaniel should support better way multi file invocation override this method have multi file invocation 
SATD	 todo refactor this task configuration extend copy task and use replace tokens 
SATD	 todoreuse refactor after removing reuse this horrendously bad need set the platform before the defaults rules nativebinaryrules assign the toolchain cant just assign the toolchain here because the initializer would closing over the toolchain which not reusable and this breaks model reuse here are just closing over the safely reusable things and then using proper dependencies for the tool chain registry unfortunately cant the create action because that would fire after defaults rules have use defaults rule assign the tool chain because needs there user mutate rules least the file locations that they can tweaked 
SATD	 check enum equality without checking loading classloader there slight risk that two versions the same enum class are compared thats why classloaders are used equality checks but checking both name and ordinal should make this very unlikely 
SATD	 todo version could different from main artifacts version 
SATD	 should really parameter the withcontent methods baked into the accessor 
SATD	 todo error messages todo display names for this container and the provider implementations 
SATD	 not subtypes dont know whether they are immutable not 
SATD	 todo this check should really done the compiler process 
SATD	 forced dependencies are only supported for enforced platforms currently hardcoded should want add this first class concept gradle metadata then should available the component variant metadata well 
SATD	 was created during execution 
SATD	 todo this doesnt quite guarantee immutability because the source may holding closures that are doing god knows what 
SATD	 todo get rid entirely and replace with collection link outputs 
SATD	 todolptr have the paths the projects serve input maybe 
SATD	 this could handled just not implemented yet 
SATD	 this not very beautiful but some point will get rid favor the writable resource 
SATD	 this bit cheesy but letter classname surely means generic type and the warning will useless 
SATD	 creates instance the given task type without invoking its constructors this used recreate task instance from the instant execution cache review this 
SATD	 todo should include some context what the rule was trying create mutate 
SATD	 todo get this from somewhere else 
SATD	 this here trigger creation the shutdowncoordinator could this nicer way 
SATD	 todopm move this when scope changed 
SATD	 todo outputeventlistener and buildstandardinput are perbuild settings down the road should refactor the code accordingly and potentially attach them 
SATD	 this occurs while running gradle running integration tests indicative problem this occurs while running unit tests then either use the the usesnativeservices annotation 
SATD	 ugly but there are few places where need instantiate javadebugoptions and regular objectfactory service not available 
SATD	 todo adding the parent project first because the converter needs this way atm this oversimplified the converter should not depend the order reactor projects should add coverage for nested multiproject builds with multiple parents 
SATD	 rough implementation get something work 
SATD	 todo this not great paradigm for creating temporary directory see for alternative 
SATD	 todo this should part the cached result 
SATD	 implementation currently dumb can made smarter 
SATD	 todo this can throw npe will need identifier for variant without owning component 
SATD	 this implementation broken does not consider include and exclude patterns 
SATD	 todo lja using the root the nodestate here bit cheat investigate can track the proper nodestate 
SATD	 produces artifactidentifier for this artifact its not actually identifier just bucket attributes todoadam remove this 
SATD	 todo this will leave invalid types the cache when fails 
SATD	 should repositories able participate incremental the least they may able express themselves output files they might have input files and other dependencies well though inputs the credentials they need may expressed file dependencies cant think case here 
SATD	 todo have much better here 
SATD	 todolptr this should defaults each 
SATD	 todo should refactor this general compatibility mapping solution have for model loading see class 
SATD	 this heuristic more than truth possible that the long hashs are identical and that the sizes collections are identical but its extremely unlikely never happened test cases even large dependency graph 
SATD	 failing seems that set method override doesnt work for iterables gradle assertthatcall bean list beanthingslist bean new linkedlistobject nullvalue equalto 
SATD	 todo this isnt quite right were leaking the implementation type here but for tasks this usually right 
SATD	 todo return richer data structure that provides meta data about how the source was found for use diagnostics 
SATD	 this method sometimes called directly not via operation executor these cases the context null 
SATD	 todolptr what with the metaclass property here 
SATD	 todo this doesnt belong here that java plugin should add extension this guy with this 
SATD	 need make this better 
SATD	 workaround for bug testng apparently fixed some listener notified twice per event 
SATD	 todo this isnt correct this means that weve detected cycle while determining the execution plan but the graph walker did not find one 
SATD	 todo simplify this class busting into locator for legacy sdks and locators for windows kits 
SATD	 todo this all terribly lame need some proper reporting here which means implementing reporting 
SATD	 todo implement these cases 
SATD	 tododaniel swift compiler should extends from abstraction nativecompiler most applies swiftcompiler 
SATD	 todo should use target platform make this decision 
SATD	 todo there should more explicit way execute action against existing services 
SATD	 have unprocessednew selector for this module need reselect the target version 
SATD	 todo assets should probably source set too 
SATD	 use the class generator instead 
SATD	 todo implement this moving this resolver live alongside the external resolvers 
SATD	 todo this should use the same mutationvalidator infrastructure that use for other mutation types 
SATD	 the cached version still current 
SATD	 todo should just cache these classloaders and ejectstop them when they are longer use 
SATD	 todo should self closed 
SATD	 replace returns the sets the with the 
SATD	 todolptr should collect all source sets the project source set however this messes 
SATD	 todo only log expired workers count log their identity once they are nameabledescribable 
SATD	 todo this not nice work out better way collect the plugin requests from invoking the plugins block 
SATD	 todo this braindead way ensure that the reference projects model ready access 
SATD	 todo this not quite right given aabb the result should and but will fact and 
SATD	 the very first event starts the initializing phase todo should use determine the build start time 
SATD	 todo configure eclipse projects too 
SATD	 there any other parent properties 
SATD	 todo bust this hierarchy and compose using interfaces instead 
SATD	 simulate stuck worker theres probably way inject this failure 
SATD	 todo this should outgoing variant the component under test 
SATD	 add install task todo should probably not add this for all executables 
SATD	 todolptr why dont check runningnodes here like hasnodesremaining 
SATD	 dumb terminal doesnt support ansi control codes todo remove this when use terminal rather than jansi render console 
SATD	 amount immutable value some quantity such duration length each amount has decimal value and associated units todo need sort out scaling when dividing converting between units 
SATD	 todo move this propertyvalue instead 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 implementation note only necessary override visit methods for ast nodes that reference statements for closureexpression rely the assumption that always references blockstatement and hence our visitblockstatement method gets called 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this insanity needed for the case where someone calls someplugin that the plugin container has the instance that want but dont think cant know has been applied 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo make this work with pending elements 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todoadam switch the logging back loggerdebugignoring failure extract throwable cause ignored 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo add stripped symbols the installation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo all this matching stuff constant for given dependencymetadata instance 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo move baseservices once the progresslogger dependency removed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo get normal resolving set declaring class 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 library albeit only for selected classes that run high risk being statically referenced from transform 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 necessary for groovy compilation pick output regular and joint java compilation and for joint java compilation pick the output regular java compilation assumes that output regular java compilation which not under this tasks control also goes into could configure this source set level but then would end the compile class path every compile task for that source set which may not desirable 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note aether implicitly uses thread pool and tasks perform transfers manually propagate the current build operation ref logging correctly associated 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo reuse more 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todohh use managed views for this only applied when the respective language applied 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 all these field names are really long prevent collisions with the groovy setters groovy will try set the private fields given the opportunity this makes much more difficult for this happen accidentally 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should use projectstate instead 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this should live closer the project itself 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont force evaluation rules here let the task container what needs 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 other home dir cached and not use clean 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo combine these with mutationguard 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 its true right now that this always coming from the testkit but might not the future 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 resolving project component can cause traversal other projects which point could release the project lock and allow another task run cant use cache loader here because synchronized the other task also tries resolve project component can block trying get the lock around the loader while still holding the project lock avoid this deadlock check then release the project lock only need resolve the project and ensure that only the thread holding the lock can populate the metadata for project 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todoadam switch the logging back loggerdebugignoring failure serialize throwable ignored 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo reuse more buildactionsfactory 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 can only set once should really part the constructor can only set once should really part the constructor 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 create the listener adapters right when the are instantiated but earlier this ensures that when multiple requests are issued that are built from the same builder such requests not share any state kept the listener adapters the listener adapters perrequest caching such caching must not leak between different requests built from the same builder 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note dont actually remove this the deprecation here encourage people use objectfactory instead just remove the overload and the nag and leave the method here 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo use ivyartifact here 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not sure under what scenario any this would occur but theres sense collecting the descriptor does 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo set acl here necessary 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the task status line may appear twice once for the execution once for the uptodateskippedetc dont add the task list this update previously added task 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 rewording exception message get rid the fqcn contains 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todocedric this approximation when component wants compile against the assembly library not the jar then should give the stubbed classes instead the raw classes however theres such thing stubbed classes assembly for performance reasons only the classes that belong the api are stubbed would miss the classes that not belong the api this makes the usagekindapi misleading should this compile 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo use circular buffers avoid copying todo share single initializer with multichannelqueue 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 collect this early the process current directory can change during embedded test execution 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo fix the way work out which exception important not always the most helpful 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo ultimately this should some kind party dependency thats visible dependency management 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should not happen 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 notify threads that may waiting this task complete this required because although all builds may share the same coordination service the something may have changed event that fired when task this build completes happens before the state tracked here updated and the worker threads the consuming build may think the task has not completed and back sleep waiting for some other event happen which may not signalling again here means that all worker threads all builds will woken which can expensive would much better avoid duplicating the task state here and instead have the task executors communicate directly with each other possibly via some abstraction that represents the task outcome 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todolptr this should added only the scan plugin applied but expects added also when the build cache enabled but not the scan plugin 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note the jdk code create sslcontexts relies the values the given system properties prevent concurrent changes system properties from interfering with this need synchronize accessmodifications system properties this best effort since cant prevent user code from modifying system properties willynilly the most critical system property javahome changing this property while trying create sslcontext can cause many strange problems 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this performance optimization most modules not declare capabilities instead systematically registering implicit capability for each module that see only consider modules which declare capabilities they then try find module which provides the same capability that module has been found then register otherwise have nothing this avoids most registrations 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo basically dont support copying custom javadoc options 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo change the default location for these reports follow the convention defined 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the matching very simple the moment but should solve majority cases operates using stringcontains and tests either requested selected module 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need validate that the selected configuration still matches the consumer attributes note that this validation only occurs when null otherwise would select with attribute matching 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo this exists because detect all available native tool chains system clang gcc swiftc msvc many our old tests assume that available tool chains can compile manymost languages they not try restrict the required set tool chains the swiftc tool chain can build only swift tests that expect use the swiftc tool chain properly annotate their requirements with versionspecific requirement our multitest runner smart enough disable tests that not meet the tests requirements but since many the old tests not have requirements assume the tests require like tool chain gcc clang msvc the future want back old tests and annotate them with tool chains requirements 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todohh 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont handle variables the moment because users didnt request yet and would probably push add support the tooling api retrieve the variable mappings 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this special case for backwards compatibility possible have cycle where the root component depends library which transitively depends different version the root module this case effectively allow modules have the same capability filter the nodes coming from transitive dependencies 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should ask the annotation handler figure this out instead 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 cannot configure slfj logger this will happen tests are executed with custom classloader using tests are run with modulepath effectively hiding gradle classes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when deriving variants for the java ecosystem actually have components mixed together the library and the platform and theres way figure out what was the intent when was published derive variants but also need use generic javaapi and javaruntime attributes instead more precise javaapijars and javaruntimejars because the platform aspect which arent jars but something using javaapijars for the library part and javaapi for the platform would lead selection the platform when dont want them other words single component cannot mix precise usages with more generic ones 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 inject missing interfaces support the usage plugins compiled with older gradle versions normal gradle build does this adding the the class loader hierarchy test run which essentially plain java application the classpath flattened and injected into the system class loader and there exists gradle class loader hierarchy the running test see implementation and gradleworkermain thus inject the missing interfaces directly into the system class loader used load all classes the test 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note there deliberately internal synchronizing caching this level class generation should performed behind managedproxyfactory 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should use some variation defaultclassmap below associate values with classes currently retain strong reference each value for one session after the classloader for the entrys key discarded which unnecessary because wont attempt locate the entry again once the classloader has been discarded 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when the artifacts declared component are modified for publishing then the maven publication longer represents the underlying java component instead publishing incorrect metadata fail any attempt publish the module metadata the long term will likely prevent any modification artifacts added from component instead will make easier modify the components produced project allowing the published metadata accurately reflect the local component metadata 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 sourceset has access configurations where could ask for lenient view this means have deal with possible dependency resolution issues here catch and log the exceptions here that the eclipse model can generated even there are unresolvable dependencies defined the configuration can probably better inspecting the runtime classpath and finding out which configurations are part and only traversing any extra file collections manually 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 send endofline this workaround convince the console that the cursor the start the line avoid indenting the next line text that displayed would better for the console listen for stuff read from stdin that would also echoed the output and update its state based this 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for project dependencies deduplication ignore scope purpose ignore version because maven doesnt support dependencies with different versions different scopes ignore exclusions because dont know how choosemerge them consequence that use the highest version and the exclusions highest priority dependency when deduplicating use maven dependency management key discriminator 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo given that all the closures are from the same file should the relativising once that would entail adding location information the model outer closure 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need move those implicit jvm args that contain space the gradle commandline possible note that this isnt strictly correct some system properties can only set jvm start should change the implementation deal with these properly

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this means that receive output before even starting any class too late dont have place for such output any the reports skipping unfortunately this happens pretty often with current level testng support because output events emitted constructor beforetest beforeclass are sent before test start event started and there parent class event emitted testng short the testng support could better see also

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo these should moved off separate type 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 remembers the unresolved dependency for later logging and also adds fake file dependency with the file path pointing the attempted component selector this shows the ide red flag the dependencies view thats not the best usability and also muddies the api contract because disguise unresolved dependency file dependency even though that file really doesnt exist instead when generating files the command line the logged warning enough when using the tooling api dedicated unresolved dependency object would better and could shown notification the command line warning should probably omitted that case 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the configuration has been used resolution and error for build logic change any dependencies exclude rules parent configurations values that will affect the resolved graph

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 clean the interrupted status because some test class processors work here junitplatform

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 new value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 look for provider with that name 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 list modules based metadata files artifact version not considered 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this safety net its unsure whether this can happen because its likely certain that for specific module resolve state all selectors are the same type 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 conflict resolution choose the best out current selection and candidate 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 remove slfj error out like class path contains multiple slfj bindings see 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 that the state node when was selected but the selection violates constraint reject strictly 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 assuming that the diagnostics were printed out the last line its not bulletproof but seems doing fine

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 was previously traversed and change the set modules that are linked outgoing edges dont need traverse again but hang the new filter since may change the set excluded artifacts

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo are relying the registration having established these links should checking 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 forward output immediately when the focus this operation group 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note that compileclasspath here approximation and must fixed before deincubating see 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this means the client has not reported memory usage yet 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 first let antlr preprocess the grammars 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note currently extract this information from the execution plan because its buried under functions filter this could detangledsimplified introducing analog this too drastic change for the stage the release cycle were exposing this information was necessary therefore the minimal change solution was implemented

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 possibly inner class 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 file loop exceptions are ignored when encounter loop via symbolic links continue include all the other files apart from the loop this way include each file only once 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when dependency resolution has failed dont want the build operation listeners fail well because the failed method will have been called with the user facing error such error may still lead valid dependency graph

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need compute hash for constant which based the name the constant its value otherwise miss the case where class defines several constants with the same value when two values are switched nonprivate const 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 tries minimize the number requests the resolution engine batching requests for sourcesjavadoc there still some inefficiency because the artifactcollection interface does not provide detailed failure results have fall back the more expensive resolutionresult api should fix this other ide vendors will face the same problem 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not sure this can happen unless error state 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 ignore these test suites 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 skip exact matches 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 runtime check because method used from groovy where type bounds are not respected

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 maybe this type belongs the same package the node that doing the static import that case the package may not have been explicitly specified try with the nodes package too still not found revert original type name 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not marked nullable because groovy compiler bug 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this happens for ibm jdk for nested interfaces see lets try return something close possible the intended value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not public evaluation these specs major hot spot for large builds use array for iteration 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 expire compatible idle not recently used daemons after short time 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the values are based what have found and zinc documentation hard say what effect they have the incremental build 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not zip file

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add outgoing configurations and publications 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 eliminate the common root 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the strategy for sharing build cache configuration across included builds composite requires that the cache configuration finalized and cache controller available before configuring them this achieves that

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 mark all affected configurations observed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 filtering place 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 these will also copied across any daemon used 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 exactly visual studio 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this approach should generally work because the moment reset capturing output per suite see and that reset happens earlier the chain theory when suite completed the output redirector has been already stopped and there shouldnt any output events passed see also gradle 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when daemon process has started yet 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this workaround for 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dummy rule cause the extension realized 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the registered nodes may contain nodes which are longer selected dont remove them from the list the first place because proved slower than filtering needed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this necessary because for the tooling api compatibility runner nativeservices can get initialized different classloader which then makes broken and unusable the test class because the native shared library loaded from another classloader initializing here ensure that loaded from the classloader the test class also uses 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generate public extensioncontainer getextensions return getconvention

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use the highest preferred version that refines the chosen require selector 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when not running from gradle distro need runtime impl for launcher plus the search path look for other modules 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 avoid silent retry 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 skipwhenempty implies incremental this file property empty then clean the previously generated outputs that means that there very close relation between the file property and the output 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 cannot compute task execution time because need association with source set

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo fix tests that rely this being set before process arguments like this 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 used generated code 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this deals with the fact that testng there are classlevel events but nevertheless want see the class name use rather than separator make clear that the class not separate level this matters when configuring granularity

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 setup component 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo lock this down

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this should turn into set converters some point 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 important that this constructed the client that has the right gradlehomedir and other state internally 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 convention

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this line must last 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 replace deprecated usage values 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 basically see operation with logging header and its not grouped just log 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use reflection support older jvms while supporting java

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only interrupt poller thread its not current thread 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 used maintain timer

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 these could injected directly too 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 used ensure the suffix isnt matching any part the prefix 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 ignore future states the input node 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 could precomputed but avoid doing attributes are never requested 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 its often the case that all the candidate values are the same this case avoid the creation set and just iterate until find different value then only this case lazily initialize set and collect all the candidate values 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 adding custom test listeners before gradles listeners this way custom listeners are more powerful and for example they can change test status 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 some validation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo match with status order versions correctly 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check other behaviour still works 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check already resolved results for compatible version and use for this dependency rather than reresolving 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 evaluate init scripts 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 its intersection and this method always called the remainder reduction operation the remainder empty then means that the intersection empty 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 any available gcc compatible implementation including mingw cygwin and clang 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when annotation processing isnt required its better add the groovy stubs part the source path this allows compilations complete faster because only the groovy stubs that are needed the java source are compiled 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note there isnt much can about collectionmatching filters the spec requires realized element unless make major changes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 presence capabilities bound the definition capabilities extension the project 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not change the order members used hash code here its been empirically tested reduce the number collisions large dependency graph performance test 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have received all requests have released something downstream can wait this isnt quite right 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 avoid creating copy the resulting configuration identical

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not empty may match any case above 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 host 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 remove the deprecations message deprecated gradle features use warningmode all see httpsdocsgradleorg and additional newline 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 must add the implicit capability here because assumed that theres rule addcapability would effectively add capability the implicit one must not forgotten 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 stop handling disconnects blocks until the handler has finished stop the connection this means that the thread receiving from the connection will receive null and finish stop receiving incoming messages blocks until the receive thread has finished this will notify the stdin and receive queues signal end input stop the receive queue unblock any threads blocked receive stop handling stdin blocks until the handler has finished discards any queued input

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont serialise the module dependencies this stage need keep track the mapping module dependency resolved dependency 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 intentionally consider execution done before doing afterevaluate the android plugin relies this behaviour 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 other stuff

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont write the rightmost column some consoles the cursor will wrap the next line and currently wrapping causes layout weirdness 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not store the history there was failure and the outputs did not change since then the next execution can incremental for example the current execution fails because compile failure and for the next execution the source file fixed only the one changed source file needs compiled

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 perform conflict resolution 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 caches the list dependency states which are not excluded 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 relative coordinate system 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the first call getconfiguration done before getderivedvariants called then means were using the legacy matching without attributes and that the metadata construct should not include the constraints keep the constraints the descriptors because actually use attribute matching can select the platform variant which does use constraints 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 synchronizes the system properties because ivysettings iterates over them without taking defensive copy this can fail another process sets system property that moment 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 antlr always returning

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not substitute plugins from same build builds that were not explicitly included 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 noinspection 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this approximation all compiled sources will use the same task dependency 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 shorten args and write out optionstxt file this must called only once per execute 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this point the workinprogress area may may not have been resized due maximum size constraint 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 using string instead plain here might look strange but this turned out the fastest several experiments including using moduleidentifier initial implementation using moduleidentifier through for interning using level map group then name using interned string for the cachedid interning turned out cost much what gain from faster checks maps and none them reached the performance just using good old string 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 copy the raw form 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not use timestamp that the same the end the last build the start this build 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when using keep the old behaviour all file inputs being incremental

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 throws exception 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this set represents the order which elements are inserted the store either actual provided construct correct iteration order from this set 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 yeah setting the background intensity not underlining but its best can using the windows console api

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 adds action which executed before this collection mutated with the addition removal elements any exception thrown the action will veto the mutation todo combine this with the mutationguard rework behave with the mutation validators used only expect used with addremove methods and fail when correctly try also prevent allwithtypeetc mutation methods only used addremove methods but should remove this special handling and fix and 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 null the constructorselector says its 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 create log file 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 show all operation output when debug enabled 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 transition any other nodes that depend the predecessor state 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 element names can only contain colon see the name has prefix evaluate both prefix and name 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 coerce the value the property type known 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 very expensive when the property not known instead reach into the meta class call much more efficient lookup method since this hot code path also reuse the argument array used for the reflective call save memory 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont collect build dependencies not required 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 please keep the formatting below helps enabling disabling stages optimizes for nulls params mandatory caches the result operations performs algebra caches the result optimization operations the end the chain mandatory shares the same caches the top level one after reducing can find already cached merge operations 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not part the public api 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 cleanup old html report directories 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 fix problems updating jar files disabling default caching url connections urlconnection default caching should disabled since causes jar file locking issues and jvm crashes updating jar files changes jar files wont noticed all cases when caching enabled leaves the jarfile instance open urlconnection caching enabled 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 here means that have validated that the entry still uptodate and that means couple things the cache policy said that the entry still valid for example refreshdependencies wasnt called the rule cacheable have validated that its discovered inputs are still the same

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 caching involves distinct caches that scripts with the same hash classpath not get compiled twice first look for cache script which path hash matches this cache invalidated when the compile classpath the script changes then look into the cache for generic script with the same hash that will remapped the script class name both caches can closed directly after use because for the script changes its compile classpath changes different directory will used for the script changes different cache used the classpath changes the cache invalidated but classes are remapped anyway never directly used

SATD	 returns the default instance the particular type toolchain can return codenullcode not applicable todo keep around 
SATD	 todo extensions like flex mojos use custom scopes like merged internal external etc order dont break backwardcompat with those only warn but dont error out 
SATD	 todo this needs accept link returned link but its not used like that 
SATD	 its the building the grandchild project having already cached the child project but not the parent project which causes the problem 
SATD	 todo would like get rid this jvz 
SATD	 note this should considered quirk support interop with mavens legacy artifactdeployer which processes one artifact time and hence cannot associate the artifacts from the same project use the same timestampbuildno for the snapshot versions allowing the caller pass metadata from previous deployment allows reestablish the association between the artifacts the same project 
SATD	 ignore the parent artifact will handle metadata must fail silently here avoid problems with the artifact transformers 
SATD	 todo really wondering where this method belongs smells like should mavenproject but for some reason isnt this localization kindof code smell 
SATD	 todo hack because metadata isnt generated correctly and want run the maven have the 
SATD	 todo this does not belong here 
SATD	 this foul 
SATD	 note theres and 
SATD	 derive the path portion the given url param url the repository url return the basedir the repository todo need url decode for spaces 
SATD	 todo restore these makes sense 
SATD	 todo could the configuration passed lookup and the configurator known plexus via the descriptor that this method could entirely handled plexus lookup 
SATD	 todo error reporting 
SATD	 exceptions 
SATD	 fail fast runtimeexceptions errors and other throwables assume these are system errors and further build meaningless 
SATD	 todo this replacing shouldnt necessary userhome should the 
SATD	 todo currently this first wins but really should take the latest comparing either the snapshot timestamp some other timestamp later encoded into the metadata todo this needs repeated here the merging doesnt interfere with the written metadata wed much better having pristine input and ongoing metadata for merging instead 
SATD	 todo what about wildcards just specifying groups versions 
SATD	 todo use stringutils here 
SATD	 todo from concurrency perspective this class not good the combination mutableimmutable state not nice 
SATD	 todo probably want warn the user that building artifact with different values than 
SATD	 not sure this last regexp was really intended disallow the usage network paths userhome directory unfortunately did removed and have not detected any problems yet path pathreplaceall 
SATD	 needs away 
SATD	 todo better way than static this might hide messages reactor 
SATD	 this exception thrown application attempts attach two the same artifacts single project author pgier author jdcasey todo make this checked exception and modify the api mavenprojecthelper currently this modification would create compatibility problems for existing plugins 
SATD	 dont canonicalize unix avoid interfering with symlinks 
SATD	 todo lifecycles being executed todo what runs each phase todo plugins that need downloading todo project dependencies that need downloading todo unfortunately the plugins need downloaded order get the pluginxml file need externalize this from the plugin archive todo this will the class that people get ides modify 
SATD	 would ever need this should not exposed public api 
SATD	 note for plugins that depend other plugin artifacts the plugin realm contains more than one plugin descriptor however only the first descriptor interest 
SATD	 assume wont ever 
SATD	 todo not sure about this here and may want getlog here wellinstead 
SATD	 todo does this check need happen here had add the same call below when iterate child nodes will that suffice 
SATD	 todo mng changes likely made this redundant 
SATD	 todo move this plexusutils pathtool 
SATD	 find the version this total hack see previous comment 
SATD	 note this primarily keep backwardcompat with maven which did not validate that dependencies are unique within single pom upon multiple declarations just kept the last one but retained the order the first occurrence when were lenientcompat mode have deal with such broken poms and mimic the way works when were strict mode the removal duplicates just saves other merging steps from aftereffects and bogus error messages 
SATD	 todo validate for 
SATD	 note theres notion tasksegment equality 
SATD	 mng neither have reserved all the above magic expressions nor their set fixedwellknown gets occasionally extended newer maven versions this imposes the risk for existing plugins unintentionally use such magic expression for ordinary system property here check whether ended with magic value that not compatible with the type the configured mojo parameter string could still converted the configurator leave those alone back off evaluating the expression from properties only 
SATD	 this not ideal but there are events specifically for configuration from the cli which dont believe are really valid but there are its which assert the right events are published this needs supported the eventspydispatcher needs put the clirequest that can accessed configuration processors 
SATD	 todo could use map maybe the parent did that for components too this too vulnerable 
SATD	 deprecated 
SATD	 todo current policy retain the original version this correct need strategies that handled elsewhere 
SATD	 todo the configuration for the lifecycle needs externalized that can use the annotations properly for the wiring and reference and external source for the lifecycle configuration 
SATD	 todo similar test should created test the dependency management basically all usages are affected mng 
SATD	 todo shouldnt the versions merged across relocations 
SATD	 todo this should not need handed off 
SATD	 note this will not hit for maven projectxml incompatible schema 
SATD	 todo push all common bits back plexus cli and prepare for transition guice dont need ways make clis 
SATD	 metadata resolution exceptions 
SATD	 todo why this using the context 
SATD	 todo jul check this were using and there are aggregator tasks this will result weirdness 
SATD	 validate versions arent inherited when using parent ranges the same way when read externally 
SATD	 todo need externalize clirequest 
SATD	 should get whole slew dependencies resolving this artifact transitively 
SATD	 note should not inheriting status since this assessment the pom quality note should not inheriting relocation since this relates single pom 
SATD	 todo could more efficient sorting the list and then moving along the restrictions order 
SATD	 set the recommended version todo maybe its better just pass the range through retrieval and use transformation 
SATD	 there are too many dont know which one run report the error 
SATD	 any 
SATD	 exception that occurs when artifact file used but has not been resolved author portera todo may better for artifactgetfile throw perhaps runtime exception 
SATD	 todo log message throw exception 
SATD	 note this exists merely for backwardcompat with legacystyle lifecycle definitions and allows configuration injection work instead failing 
SATD	 this class needs stick around because was exposed the the remote resources plugin started using instead getting the repositories from the project 
SATD	 maven quirk artifact always points the local repo regardless whether resolved not 
SATD	 todo optimize maybe just rewrite the whole way aggregating mojos are being run 
SATD	 ignore plugin descriptor parsing errors this point these errors will reported during calculation project build execution plan 
SATD	 note getid was added and such not implemented plugins compiled against apis 
SATD	 todo dont catch exception 
SATD	 this should probably separate tool and not baked into maven 
SATD	 not totally sure this needed for anything 
SATD	 todo use settings 
SATD	 todo whether duplicates should removed looks like option for the generated merger 
SATD	 todo these two tests display lack symmetry with respect the input which free form string and the mojo descriptor which comes back all the free form parsing needs done somewhere else this really the function the cli and then the preprocessing that output still needs fed into hinting process which helps flesh out the full specification the plugin the plugin manager should only deal concrete terms all version finding mumbo jumbo customization base functionality the plugin manager provides 
SATD	 todo this will the basis the customizable lifecycle execution need figure this out quickly 
SATD	 todo use the following two instead manageartifact todo remove interface 
SATD	 note this sanity check the cache hit the cached parent pom was locally resolved the childs relativepath should point that parent too doesnt ignore the cache and resolve externally mimic the behavior the cache didnt exist the first place otherwise the cache would obscure bad pom 
SATD	 fixme this hacky what module directory doesnt match artifactid and parent coming from the repository 
SATD	 note currently unchecked careful removing this trycatch this necessary avoid creating compatibility problems for existing plugins that use 
SATD	 note some plugins like surefire access this field directly 
SATD	 describes version transformation during artifact resolution author portera todo try and refactor remove abstract mainmethods not particular happy about current design 
SATD	 return the required dependencies specified scope todo the name not intelligible 
SATD	 todo shouldnt need double this work only done for simplicity handling recommended 
SATD	 trying give loggers back bad idea ceki said notice self what was this method supposed 
SATD	 mng mng building plugins with extensions cannot part reactor 
SATD	 todo kristian wonders this class really necessary and overlaps other concepts 
SATD	 todo might better have sourceretrieve throw specific exception for this situation 
SATD	 this should probably moved separate stub 
SATD	 this really wagon something went wrong after successfully retrieved the metadata 
SATD	 filter exclude from list artifact patterns author portera todo think this equiv exclusion set filter mavencore 
SATD	 todo this only provide project for plugins that dont need project execute but need some the values from mavenproject ideally this should something internal and nothing outside maven 
SATD	 todo why mvn adds dot paths 
SATD	 warn set anything other than ignore 
SATD	 todo introducing space herenot sure what else but collapse whitespace 
SATD	 describes repository directory metadata author portera todo not happy about the store method they use this 
SATD	 todo currently cannot tell which section contained the management information when the resolver provides this information these log messages should updated contain 
SATD	 todo hack make the cycle detection the same for the new graph builder 
SATD	 todo the antrun plugin has its own configurator the only plugin that does might need think about how that works todo remove the 
SATD	 todo jvz why isnt all this checking the job the duty the workspace resolver know that have model that suitable yet more checks are done here and the one for the version problematic before because with parents ranges will never work this scenario 
SATD	 todo the order the merged list could controlled attribute the model association targetfirst sourcefirst dominantfirst recessivefirst 
SATD	 after the collection will have the artifact object the result but they will not resolved yet 
SATD	 todo add better exception 
SATD	 todo let the scope handler deal with this 
SATD	 these are cases where the artifact just isnt present any the remote repositories because wasnt deployed was deployed the wrong place 
SATD	 and catch here rather than have return null 
SATD	 inspection unchecked 
SATD	 this just silly lookuplist should return empty list 
SATD	 todo this needs colorized 
SATD	 todo whether the merge continues recursively into existing node not could option for the generated merger 
SATD	 mavenapi fixme the dag used not only used represent the dependency relation but also for parent buildplugin reports need multiple dags since dag can only handle type relationship properly usecase this detected cycle parent orgapachemavenmaven inherited reporting dependency this case both the verify and the report goals are called different lifecycle though the compilerplugin has valid usecase although that seems work fine need take versions and lifecycle into account 
SATD	 dont want the artifacts version here this stored the directory above that 
SATD	 use regular expression search find and resolve expressions within the pom author jdcasey created feb todo consolidate this logic with the minus deprecationsbans 
SATD	 this should take care creating destination directory now 
SATD	 fixme filter out the inherited false stuff 
SATD	 todo plugindescriptor classrealm and artifacts are set side effect this call which not nice throws 
SATD	 need set the file here the resolver will fail with npe not fully equipped deal with multiple local repository implementations yet 
SATD	 todo was null really need find them now this taken care the ordering 
SATD	 mng the artifact data has changed the available versions where previously retrieved need update 
SATD	 this wont valid but constructs something easy read the error message 
SATD	 todo this should eventually migrated 
SATD	 this means module which build has dependency which has the same groupid artifactid version and classifier coordinates this consequence self reference other words circular reference which can not being resolved 
SATD	 note other configurators like the maporiented one dont call into the listener the hard way 
SATD	 wraps active project instance able receive updates from its artifact without affecting the original attributes this artifact author portera todo think this exposes design flaw that the immutable and mutable parts artifact are one class and should split scope file etc depend the context use whereas everything else immutable 
SATD	 these mainmethods deal with construction intact plugin object that look like they come from standard plugin block maven pom have some wiggling pull the sources information together and this really shows the problem constructing sensible default configuration but its all encapsulated here appears normalized the pom builder 
SATD	 some better conventions for the test poms needs created and each these tests that represent verification specification item needs couple lines most the expressions help lot but need clean pick directory poms automatically load them into resolver create the expression extract the data validate the model and the uri validate the properties also need way navigate from the tex specification documents 
SATD	 todo classpath check doesnt belong here thats the other method 
SATD	 todo not entirely the same message 
SATD	 todo this could lot nicer should really the snapshot transformation 
SATD	 todo should this part mediation 
SATD	 fixme somehow report the user that there are too many elements for now ignore the extra 
SATD	 mng hack workaround deficiency legacy api which makes impossible for plugins access the global profile manager which required build pom like cli invocation does failure consider the activated profiles can cause repo declarations lost which turn will result artifact resolution failures particular when using the enhanced local repo which guards access local files based the configured remote repos 
SATD	 todo without this could just evaluate call 
SATD	 builder concurrency and parallelism preserve the existing mainmethods for builder selection which look for various inputs the threading configuration dont have easy way allow pluggable builder provide its own configuration parameters but this sufficient for now ultimately want components like builders provide way extend the command line accept its own configuration parameters 
SATD	 todo ick this forces the oce that should have come from the previous call still 
SATD	 maybe its better move some those mainmethods separate class soc 
SATD	 todo not sure how best set these for this implementation 
SATD	 note this should considered quirk support interop with mavens legacy artifactdeployer which processes one artifact time and hence cannot associate the artifacts from the same project use the same version index allowing the caller pass metadata from previous deployment allows reestablish the association between the artifacts the same project 
SATD	 todo shouldnt need file intermediatary improve wagon take stream 
SATD	 todo should deprecate 
SATD	 shouldnt javasources given the classifier shouldnt false given the classifier 
SATD	 validation error continue project building and delay failing help ides 
SATD	 the bean containing the mojo descriptorbr for more information about the usage tag have look todo there need for the delegation mavenmojodescriptor this why not just extend componentdescriptor here 
SATD	 todo add better exception that can detail the two conflicting artifacts 
SATD	 todo remove this 
SATD	 mkleint does this need public 
SATD	 todo also this logging for other metadata 
SATD	 note from empty string and null both denote classifier however some plugins only check for null sure nullify empty classifier 
SATD	 todo not sure that should assume this maybe the calls addmetadata should premerge then artifact replaces 
SATD	 why are just ignoring this exception are exceptions are being used for flow control 
SATD	 todo this too early for build extensions maybe just remove 
SATD	 need get the latest file for the project not the artifact that was created one point time 
SATD	 the workspacereactor flux better not assume definitive information for any its artifactsprojects 
SATD	 blech this isnt even intelligible method name provided for consistency 
SATD	 note intentionally only support basedir and not projectbasedir the latter form would suggest that other project expressions can used which however beyond the design 
SATD	 pseudo test generate documentation fragment about supported cli options todo such documentation generation code should not necessary unit test but should run during site generation velocity doxia macro 
SATD	 todo throw something instead

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should not happen 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 will jndi lookup get home but wont call create could actually try figure out interface from create 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo could call the conversion service convert the value string 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use defaults 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this test bit fragile but gets the job done proving that attempt was made look the aspect its due classpath issues integrationtests that its not found 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 errors instance even errors 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo this currently passes because the datestring constructor fallback used 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 fixme revisit case reentrant sync deadlock 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 throw fallback producer exception since original was probably 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo objectclass unresolvable 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 unknown exception typically wrapper with common mvc exception cause since exceptionhandler type declarations also match firstlevel causes only deal with toplevel mvc exceptions here lets rethrow the given exception for further processing through the chain 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 fields for the control flow and data flow graph analysis algorithms used compute the maximum stack size the stack map frames control flow graph contains one node per basic block and one edge per jump from one basic block another each node each basic block represented with the label object that corresponds the first instruction this basic block each node also stores the list its successors the graph linked list edge objects the control flow analysis algorithms used compute the maximum stack size the stack map frames are similar and use two steps the first step during the visit each instruction builds information about the state the local variables and the operand stack the end each basic block called the output frame irelativelyi the frame state the beginning the basic block which called the input frame and which iunknowni during this step the second step link and link fix point algorithm that computes information about the input frame each basic block from the input state the first basic block known from the method signature and the using the previously computed relative output frames the algorithm used compute the maximum stack size only computes the relative output and absolute input stack heights while the algorithm used compute stack map frames computes relative output frames and absolute input frames 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 defineclass variant available all 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 important here assume that the frames are ordered the stackmaptable attribute although this not guaranteed the attribute format this allows incremental extraction the labels corresponding this attribute see the comment above for the stackmaptable attribute 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 returns the wrong declaring class for overridden read methods which turn violates expectations link extendedbeaninfo regarding method equality springs link class helps out here and now put into use extendedbeaninfo well 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo spr qualify relative path locations done 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo following lines are workaround for hibernate bug hibernate throws exception due flush actually has flushed meaning that the database was updated outside the transaction 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo verify remaining output for forms and fix whitespace 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 fails 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 corresponding qualifier factory method typically configuration class 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 usenewconnection true then obtain nonmanaged connection our modifications are handled separate transaction false then use the current transactions connection relying the use nontransactional storage engine like myisam for the incrementer table also use straight jdbc code because need make sure that the insert and select are performed the same connection otherwise cant sure that lastinsertid returned the correct value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this class can used parse other classes containing constant definitions public static final members the code asxxxx methods this class allow these constant values accessed via their string names pconsider class foo containing code public final static int constant instance this class wrapping code fooclass will return the constant value from its code asnumber method given the argument code constant pthis class ideal for use propertyeditors enabling them recognize the same names the constants themselves and freeing them from maintaining their own mapping author rod johnson author juergen hoeller since 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this will sometimes fail you use classpath instead classpath the result depends the classpath testclasses are segregated from classes and they come first the classpath like maven then breaks classes comes first like spring build then 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not necessary cast the target bridge have the same return type this conveniently includes void and primitive types which would fail casted its not possible covariant from boxed unbox vice versa having boxunbox for bridges todo also isnt necessary checkcast the return assignable from the target this would happen subclass used covariant returns narrow the return type within bridge 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 generic assignment can little confusing given listcharsequence list extends charsequence liststring allowed and often used for argument input for example see listaddall you can get items from but you cannot add items without getting generic type not applicable for the arguments error this makes sense since you added stringbuffer would break the rules not allowed since there extends cause the generic not applicable for the arguments error when adding which would pollute 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 did concurrent read transition nodemand just before 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 unresolvable type method signature probably from lazy bean lets ignore 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not advised 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 full check for complex generic type match required 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 try adapt the runtime situation that were encountering there are obviously too many different patterns coming here lets turn off the cache since the patterns are unlikely reoccurring 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo change bytebufferfeeder when supported jackson see 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 kotlin present 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for normal advice invoke target without considering advice optimized override for methods mapped this 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 different aspectj behaviour least for checked exceptions 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 call from cglib proxy handle potentially implementing factorybean method 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 jodatime present 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 something the stack when nothing needed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 duplicate duplicate 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 any the typical annotations found 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 were the two compared descriptor both for numbers 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 stubbed null arguments just for reference purposes expecting them autowired for regular singleton references safe assumption since bean singleton arguments cannot optional 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dynamic sql error cardinality violation syntax error direct sql syntax error dynamic sql general sql syntax error oracle unknown identifier 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 two errors 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 proxy not yet available but that shouldnt matter 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 jsr api not available 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the existing bean definition one that was created from configuration class allow the current bean method override since both are secondpass level however the bean method overloaded case the same configuration class 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 whats reasonable expectation for any server developer machine load seconds 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo you change type pattern from orgspringframework also matches introduction perhaps generated advisor bean definition could made depend the introduction which case this would not problem 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 encountered new context hierarchy level 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 here not extract the labels corresponding the attribute content this would require full parsing the attribute which would need repeated when parsing the bytecode instructions see below instead the content the attribute read one frame time after frame has been visited the next frame read and the labels contains are also extracted one frame time thanks the ordering frames having only one frame lookahead not problem not possible see offset smaller than the offset the current instruction and for which label exist except for uninitialized type offsets solve this parsing the stack map table without full decoding see below 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo same old age avoid ordering effect for now 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 whats reasonable expectation for any server developer machine load seconds 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 also business exception 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 maybe inner class name using the dot name syntax need use the dollar syntax here classutilsforname has equivalent check for resolution into class references later 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 long 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 override type info 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 testing some behavior 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 unlikely ever get here but must handled 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 are there array dimensions 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 custom global default 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nonstrict casing can only achieved through custom invocation handling only partial mxbean support available 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo revisit performance doing lot case insensitive matching 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo could cache singleton for minor performance optimization 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 candidate constructors for autowiring 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo support multidimensional arrays todo support correct syntax for multidimensional and not 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo must immutable list 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo used catch but with cglib some errors are proxy creation and are wrapped aspect exception error message still fine 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo one invocation from setup 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 incorrectly returns true since doesnt detect that this interface 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 looks like type reference but being used map key 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dstframe exception handler block can reached from any instruction the basic block corresponding this frame particular from the first one therefore the input locals dstframe should compatible merged with the input locals this frame and the input stack dstframe should compatible merged with one 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nothing really test enough dont get error while creating app context 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 here not extract the labels corresponding the attribute content this would require full parsing the attribute which would need repeated when parsing the bytecode instructions see below instead the content the attribute read one type annotation time after type annotation has been visited the next type annotation read and the labels contains are also extracted one annotation time this assumes that type annotations are ordered increasing bytecode offset 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 direct match for exposed instance 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 bean factorybean 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 pattern match 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo enable testng test with timeout once have solution 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo reactor usually times out windows 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use path info available indicates index page within servlet mapping with index page uri 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not valid value the key 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 bug javac type array excludes enclosing instance parameter for inner classes with least one generic constructor parameter access with the actual parameter index lowered 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 more pattern there more data pattern capturing variables there must some actual data bind them 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 these tests below verify that the chain static accesses either methodproperty field leave the right thing top the stack for processing any outer consuming code here the consuming code the stringvalueof function the wrong thing were the stack for example the compiled code for static methods wasnt popping the previous thing off the stack the valueof would operate the wrong value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not valid value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo spr spr 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 return default error view else defined 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 further todos for compilation opminus with single literal operand could treated negative literal will save pointless loading and then subtract instruction code gen allow other accessorsresolvers participate compilation and create their own code typereference followed what ends static method invocation can really skip code gen for the typereference since once that used locate the method not used again the opeq implementation quite basic will compare numbers the same type allowing them their boxed unboxed variants compare object references does not compile expressions where numbers are different types when objects implement comparable compiled nodes typereference operatorinstanceof stringliteral nullliteral realliteral intliteral longliteral booleanliteral floatliteral opor opand operatornot ternary elvis variablereference oplt ople opgt opge opeq opne opplus opminus opmultiply opdivide methodreference indexer compoundexpression functionreference inlinelist opmodulus not yet compiled some may never need assign beanreference identifier opdec opbetween opmatches oppower opinc projection qualifiedid selection 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 defensively use lazyinitializing adapter class here well since the javalogging module not present default jdk are requiring its presence neither logj nor slfj available however the case logj slfj are trying prevent early initialization the javautillog adapter jvm debug mode when eagerly trying parse the bytecode for all the cases this switch clause 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 switch manual commit necessary this very expensive some jdbc drivers dont want unnecessarily for example weve explicitly configured the connection pool set already 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 derby isnt cleaned properly this will fail 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 oldschool ehcache singleton sharing way find out whether actually created new cachemanager just received existing singleton reference 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 jpa api available but method not actually implemented persistence provider falling back regular createentitymanager method 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 any nested beans elements will cause recursion this method order propagate and preserve beans default attributes correctly keep track the current parent delegate which may null create the new child delegate with reference the parent for fallback purposes then ultimately reset thisdelegate back its original parent reference this behavior emulates stack delegates without actually necessitating one 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 simply must not bail 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 ignore when transformerfactory implementation available 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 servlet getparameternames not guaranteed include multipart form items weblogic need merge them here the safe side 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 bean name resolved handler 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 but this handled gracefully and beans from both packages are available 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not class well simply create beanshell objects through evaluating the script for every call later for this firsttime check lets simply return the already evaluated object 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 cannot evaluated cant readable 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the type the previous local variable not known yet but later appears long double should then use top instead 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 write method not matched against read method potentially ambiguous through several overloaded variants which case arbitrary winner has been chosen the jdks javabeans introspector 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should fail due duplicate configuration 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 lets skip its not resolvable were just looking for candidates 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not supplied due computemaxs 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note would like able override the value attribute however spring currently does not allow overrides for the value attribute 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the below does not work since simply checks pool empty 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 per contract body shouldnt null but check anyway 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 expected exception 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note while you might expect the main key have been updated hasnt cacheable operations are only processed case cache miss this why combining cacheable with cacheput very bad idea could refine the condition now that can figure out are going invoke the method anyway but that brings whole new set potential regressions

SATD	 todo consider adding shuffle grouping after the spout avoid much routing the argsreturninfo all over the place least until its possible just pack bolt logic into the spout itself 
SATD	 should not returned since this executor not part the topologys assignment 
SATD	 this hack for nonras scheduler topology and worker resources 
SATD	 todo move this logic the model class 
SATD	 for some reason the new code ackers null get 
SATD	 this bit hack list then component stream want format this componentstream 
SATD	 todo dry this code with whats 
SATD	 should fail the tuple kill the worker 
SATD	 todo streams should uniquely identifiable 
SATD	 fixme this class can moved webapp once porting done 
SATD	 should rewrite this file move 
SATD	 work around should get alternative working way 
SATD	 the topology zookeeper authentication configuration unset 
SATD	 class that has the logic handle tuple failure 
SATD	 error 
SATD	 read last this should cause evicted next put 
SATD	 todo more collection content type checking 
SATD	 fixme were using default config since cannot serialized still needs provide some options externally 
SATD	 todo this can only ever null someone doing something odd with mocking should really fix the mocking and remove this 
SATD	 todo put some better exception mapping todo move populatecontext filter 
SATD	 should fail the batch kill the worker 
SATD	 this triggers cannot convert null int 
SATD	 getting the exact response code bit more complex todo should use better client 
SATD	 this directory file 
SATD	 should throw 
SATD	 todo should worker even take the topologyid input this should deducible from cluster state searching through assignments what about theres inconsistency assignments but nimbus should guarantee this consistency param conf storm configuration param context param topologyid topology param assignmentid assignment param supervisorport parent supervisor thrift server port param port port which the worker runs param workerid worker 
SATD	 this bit ugly but shows how this would happen worker will use the same apis 
SATD	 race happened and probably not running 
SATD	 should not show files outside worker log root 
SATD	 fixme stores map topoconf topologycontext and expose these derived classes 
SATD	 original implementation doesnt actually check delete succeeded not 
SATD	 doesnt seem like you should have this but java serialization wacky and doesnt call the default constructor 
SATD	 this bit ugly the json are expecting should the form component resource value but because value coming from json going number and want double the goal through each entry and update accordingly 
SATD	 may though unlikely lose metering here state transition too frequent less than millisecond 
SATD	 want throw exception path doesnt exist 
SATD	 todo better way this would great 
SATD	 fixme should moved stormclient when can removed 
SATD	 todo figure out how want deal with overrides users may want add streams even when overriding other properties for now just add them blindly which could lead potentially invalid topology 
SATD	 more accurate that threadsleep but still not great 
SATD	 unexpected error 
SATD	 todo ignore the master batch coordinator 
SATD	 this test rather ugly but the only way see the error messages are working correctly 
SATD	 todo need able replace existing fields with the function fields like cascading fieldsreplace 
SATD	 todo wrap this set the stream name 
SATD	 todo this isnt right its not the map anymore 
SATD	 todo add method for drpc stream needs know how automatically return results etc too expensive batch per drpc request 
SATD	 todo the inner join incrementally emitting the cross join with this tuple against all other sides todo only cross join least one tuple each side 
SATD	 todo once everything java this should not possible any more 
SATD	 heck for backward compatibility need pass hbase conf the conf instance instance persistentmap making copy 
SATD	 this hack allow zookeepermain called this command 
SATD	 perhaps there better way this 
SATD	 todo can optimize further only querying backing map for keys not the cache 
SATD	 todo this causing issues 
SATD	 todo need invoke hook provided the topology giving chance create user resources this would part the initialization hook need separate into workercontext and workerusercontext actually just via interfaces just need make sure hide setresource from tasks 
SATD	 not implemented 
SATD	 todo what would good test ensure that least somewhat defensively copied 
SATD	 todo does this work well windows 
SATD	 filecontext supports atomic rename whereas filesystem doesnt 
SATD	 not enough guaranteed use the age the topology instead todo need good way only this once 
SATD	 todo take away knowledge storms internals here 
SATD	 todo should handle ref 
SATD	 todo make sure test these two functions manual tests 
SATD	 todo get this from type instead hardcoding nimbus establish clientserver transport via plugin 
SATD	 there bug some versions that returns for the uptime 
SATD	 this kind unnecessary for clojure 
SATD	 todo this class reserved for supporting messages with different schemas current only one schema the cache 
SATD	 bad files dir config 
SATD	 fixme can filter listkeys with local blobstore when storm going resolved workaround call getblobmeta for all keys 
SATD	 min this really means something wrong even very slow node 
SATD	 todo check for null grouping args 
SATD	 todo perhaps can adjust the frequency later 
SATD	 reestablish connection eventhub servers using the right offset tbd might optimized with cache 
SATD	 todo handle the case where there may schema 
SATD	 seems safer not follow symlinks since dont expect them here 
SATD	 this because json doesnt allow numbers keys todo replace json with better form encoding 
SATD	 todo optimize this computation perhaps inner loop can outside avoid rescanning tuples 
SATD	 couldshould use 
SATD	 likely because bug try get another way 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 failed send the jms message fail the tuple fast 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 remotetaskid jcqueue some entries maybe null emits those tasksids from this worker 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the second tuple should not ackd because the batch should cleared and this will 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 get rid multiple url 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need reverse the order elements delete files from oldest newest 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 ignored the file did not match 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the new partition should discovered and the message should emitted 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 error message returned something went wrong 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 file should moved archive 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this could fail blob gets deleted mistake dont crash nimbus 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 but that only there bug one the password providers 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 request impersonate users from unauthroized groups should rejected 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need search more not going help 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 ignore changes scheduling while downloading the topology blobs dont support canceling the download through the future yet because pending blobs may shared multiple workers and cancel may lead race condition keep everything sync just wait for all workers 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 its null one later transaction batch was emitted before this should skip this batch didnt exist and was created which case the stateinitializer was invoked and was emitted 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 shouldnt happen 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 translating the name this call happens different callback from validating the user name and password this has stateless though cannot save the password provider away sure got the same one that validated the password the password providers are written correctly this should never happen because they cannot read the name they would return null but the off chance that something goes wrong with the translation because mismatch try skip the bad one 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 json parsing fail error received 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 topo has one single huge task that can not handled the smallsuper 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 user derek submits another topology into full cluster topo should not able scheduled initially but since topo has higher priority than topo topo will evicted that topo can scheduled 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 throws ioexceptions for call next succeeds thereafter 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add the callers cache cant add the stringmetadatacache since that could cause eviction database write which want only occur from the inserting thread 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 above gives extra empty string the end below removes that 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the dir empty try delete may fail but that 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 seems this can fail returning false throwing exception convert false ret value exception 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this only used for loggingmetrics dont crash the process over 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 assumption therere put and delete for same target parameter list 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need enforcement topology level not single worker level because for cgroups each page shared memory goes the worker that touched first may need make this more plugable the future and let the resource isolation manager tell what 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for reporting errors 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 connection unavailable will drop pending messages and let atleastonce message replay kick another option would buffer the messages memory but this option has the risk causing oom errors especially for topologies that disable message acking because dont know whether the connection recovery will succeed not and how long the recovery will take 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 regardless ticketrenewwindow setting above and the ticket expiry time thread will not sleep between refresh attempts any less than minute milliseconds minute 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo add metrics 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 assume that get doesnt have any families defined this for not digging deeply 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 class path entries that are neither directories nor archives zip jar files nor the asterisk wildcard character are ignored 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when this ever null 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 maybe needs start phase where can retrieval update phase and then finish phase shouldnt really oneatatime interface since have all the tuples already tood used for the new values stream the list needed able get reduceragg and combineragg persistentaggregate for grouped streams working efficiently 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 tuples may ackedfailed after the spout deactivates have able handle this too 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not blocking call cannot emit will add tuple pendingemits and return false pendingemits can null 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not use canonical file name here are using symbolic links read file data and performing atomic move while updating files 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 comma separated list topics consumer group for which the offset needs calculated bootstrap brokers security protocol connect kafka properties file containing additional kafka consumer configs 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 process has not terminated check has completed not just destroy 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 link and several other trident classes inherit from these classes are serialized out part the bolts and spouts topology often for each boltspout the topology the following are marked transient because they are never used after the topology created keeping them around just wastes space the serialized topology 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note the queue has thread safe 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 offset committed are failed maxpollrecords are emitted fail the last tuples only offset not failed advance time the failed tuples become ready for retry and check that the spout will emit retriable tuples for all the failed tuples that are within tuples the committed offset 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 spout notified that message returned for retrying was actually emitted hence remove from set and wait for its ack fail but still keep counts map retry again failure remove ack 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 certain states might only accept onetuple keys those should just throw error 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 servers should rotated before the old client removed from clientforserver race with getwriteclient could cause put back the map 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 also fail the last tuple from partition two since the failed tuple beyond the limit should not retried until earlier messages are acked 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 field name does not match static field test matches dynamic field 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should done now 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this doesnt follow symlinks which what want 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should not seek the paused partition 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 looks like usage might not supported 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the metrics store not critical the operation the cluster allow nimbus come 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 system bolt doesnt call reporterror 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo would love standardize this 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 something happened and couldnt find the file ignore for now 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this isnt strictly necessary but doesnt hurt and ensures that the machine stays date even callbacks dont all work exactly right 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 local worker heartbeat can null cause some errorexception 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 error occurs but assignment has not changed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 doesnt manipulate tuples lists stuff that things like aggregating into cassandra cleaner dont need lists everywhere just store the single value there 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 attempt schedule multiple copies different topologies topot and topot blocks without fragmentation possible schedule all topologies but fragmentation causes topologies not schedule for the last block 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this verifies that partitions cant prevent each other from retrying tuples due the limit 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should not have flushed file system yet 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this arbitrary choice make the result consistent with calculatemin any value would valid here becase there are nonzero resources the total set resources were trying average values 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 errors 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for each partition the spout allowed retry all tuples between the committed offset and ahead not allowed retry tuples past that limit this makes the actual limit per partition maxpollrecords reached the tuple the limit the earliest retriable tuple the spout tuple below the limit and receives full maxpollrecords tuples the poll 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 non error scenarios for the azure data lake store file system adl the output stream must closed before the file associated with deleted for adlfs deleting the file also removes any handles the file hence outclose will fail 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 might need set the number acker executors and eventlogger executors the estimated number workers 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo deduplicate this logic with the code nimbus 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 new topology needs scheduled 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo jsonify stormtopology the minimum should send source info 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note variable used lambda expression should final effectively final will cause compilation error and variable type should implement the serializable interface isnt primitive type will cause not serializable exception 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have not moved java worker yet 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for some reasons can not get supervisor port info supervisor shutdown just skip for this scheduling round 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo the future this might better common webapp location 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the position behind the committed offset this can happen some cases message failed lots more than maxpollrecords later messages were acked and the failed message then gets acked the consumer may only part way through catching where was when went back retry the failed tuple skip the consumer forward the committed offset 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 most clojure tests currently try access the blobs using getblob since checks for updating the correct version the blob part nimbus before performing any operation there necessity stub several test cases ignore this method valid trade off return nimbusdetails which include the details the current nimbus host port data are not initialized part the test moreover this applies only local blobstore when used along with nimbus 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 jdk tries automatically drain the input streams for when the process exits but since close not synchronized creates race close the stream first and the same recycled the stream draining thread will attempt drain that may block oom cause bizarre behavior see issue fixed build 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nodes the descending order priority processornode has higher priority than partition and window nodes that the topological order iterator will group many processor nodes together possible has higher priority than statequeryprocessor that statequeryprocessor can mapped the same statefulbolt that part 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 last partition not evicted 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have something schedule 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 debug only once have confidence can lose this 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 just skip when any error happens wait for next round assignments reassign 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for others using too much really question how much memory free the system 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the elements having the same key within the window will grouped together and the corresponding values will merged the result pairstreamstring iterabledouble with stock symbol the key and stock prices for that symbol within the window the value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 jsonaware not working for nested element map write json format from here 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note istrategyclass enforced daemonconf error will thrown nimbus topology submission and not the client prior submitting the topology 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this happens when the key not found the cache loader returns null and this exception thrown because the cache cannot store null 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 waiting for spout tuples isnt strictly necessary since also wait for bolt emits but anyway allow two minutes for topology startup then wait for most the time should take produce windows 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo enable setstatespout gets implemented testexpected 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo handle regular rich spout without batches need lots updates support this throughout 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 since the last tuple the partition more than maxpollrecords ahead the failed tuple shouldnt emitted here 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 some cases users will want drop retrying old batches the topology should start over from scratch the ignores committed offsets should not retry batches for old topologies the batch retry should skipped entirely 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo conditionally load properties from file our resource 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this code here handles case where previous commit failed and the partitions changed since the last commit this clears out any state for the removed partitions for this txid make sure only single task ever does this were also guaranteed that its impossible for there another writer the directory for that partition because only single commit can happening once this because order for another attempt the batch commit the batch phase must have succeeded between hence all tasks for the prior commit must have finished committing whether successfully not 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this will fail since jerry doesnt have either cpu memory entries 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 try create the parent directory may not work 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo the future want way include this logic the spout itself make unnecessary having storm include metadata about which grouping tuple came from 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 leadership coordination may incomplete when launchserver called previous behavior did one time check which could cause nimbus not process transitions similar problem exists for 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 error should not leaked according the code but they are not important enough fail the build 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 testing whether acls are set worldeverything here the acl should not contain worldeverything because the subject neither null nor empty the acl should however contain usereverything user needs have complete access the blob 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use parsewithexception instead parse can capture deserialization errors the log they are likely bugs the spout code 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this possibly lossy the case where value deleted because has received messages over the metrics collection period and new messages are starting come this because dont want the overhead synchronize just have the metric absolutely perfect 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 todo add logging that not all tuples were received 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 errors bit special because older versions storm the worker created the parent directories lazily because this means need auto create least the topoid directory for all running topos 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 calling choosetasks should finished before refreshing ring adjusting might needed with really slow machine allow race condition between refreshing ring and choosing tasks will not make exact even distribution though diff expected small given that all threadtasks are finished before refreshing ring 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 error 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 below regex uses negative lookahead not split the middle json objects json arrays this needed parse valid json objectarrays passed options via stormcmd windows this not issue while using stormpy since urlencodes the options and the below regex just does split the commas that separates each option note this regex handles only valid json strings and could produce invalid results the options contain unencoded invalid json strings with unmatched can replace below code with split once stormcmd fixed send urlencoded options 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 imperative that dont emit any tuples from here since output factory cannot gotten until preparation done therefore receivers wont ready receive tuples yet cant emit tuples from here anyway since its not within batch context which only startbatch execute and finishbatch 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 failed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 eventhubs bolt configurations partition mode with partitionmodetrue you need create the same number tasks the number eventhubs partitions and each bolt task will only send data one partition the partition the task the bolt event format the formatter convert tuple bytes for eventhubs null the default format common delimited tuple fields 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need set active false before calling onkill current implementation does not return

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 just case get something are confused about can continue processing the rest the tasks 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the scheduler generally will try pack executors into workers until the max heap size met but this can vary depending the specific scheduling strategy selected the reason for this try and balance the maximum pause time might take which larger for larger heaps against better performance because not needing tuples 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 validation only configs some configs inside configjava may reference classes dont want expose stormclient but still want validate that they reference valid class allow this happen part the validation the client side with annotations static final members the config class and other validations here avoid naming them the same thing because clojure code walks these two classes and creates clojure constants for these values

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 proposedrefresh too far the future its after ticket expires simply return now 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 cached curatorframework mainly used for blobstore 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 construct message containing the sasl response and send the server 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 now check that the spout will emit another messages 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 processlatencyms 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 thread safety assumes collectoremit calls are externally synchronized needed

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only log the leader has changed not interesting otherwise 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 required required optional 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 authorize client allowed dorequest and only the client 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this spout added test purpose just failing fast doesnt hurt much 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 minimum version supporting storm would 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 advance the time and replay the failed tuple 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 boltspecific configuration for windowed bolts specify the sliding interval count number tuples 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only need keep track acked tuples commits kafka are controlled tuple acks which happens only for atleastonce processing semantics 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not close this inputstream method will used from jetty server 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 partition ids 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the current assignment already running new assignment will never promoted currassignment because timer not being compared equals equivalent meaning newassignment always equals currassignment 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this happens the min too small 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 config 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 valid delete before whats been committed since those batches will never accessed again

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 concurrent deletion only one thread should succeed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 now lets update but not advance time should get old map again 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 remove the unneeded entries from the graph want keep all our nodes and the nodes that they are connected directly parents and children 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 have enough resources now 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont emit anything allow configured spout wait strategy kick 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 was scheduled for retry and reemitted remove from schedule 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 onheap

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 setup spout with mock consumer can get the rebalance listener 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 hosts this user authorized impersonate from 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 worker crashes the states all workers are rolled back and initstate message sent across the topology that crashed workers can initialize their state the bolts that have their state already initialized need not reinitialized 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 enable 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 note that sometimes the tuples active may less than maxspoutpending maxspoutpending active acked there wont commit for because isnt committed yet and there wont batch for because theres maxspoutpending active 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 multivalue field split non default token match dynamic fields the form txt this field wont indexed solr 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 map consisting all workers the node 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 had timeout but the timeout longer active 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 sample fielddescriptor streamxyz 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this odd case for rolling upgrade where the user the old assignment may null but not the new one although all other ways they are the same this happens want use the assignment with the owner 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont override the host name everything looks like nimbus 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this also helpful optimization that state implementations dont need manually 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 sigar uses jni and does not work local mode 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for mesos this hostnametopologyid

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 there race backpressure too 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 free the error stream buffer 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 name 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 partitioned example case emitter task receives later transaction than its emitted far when sees the earlier txid should know emit nothing 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 some times bolt spout will have some memory that shared between the instances these are typically caches but could anything like static database that memory mapped into the processes these can declared separately and added the bolts and 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 creates mongouri from the given string 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 verify that only committed the message the assigned partition 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this can happen when topology first coming its thrown the blobstore code 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 fall back string which already set 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 there can more then one line cgroups are mounted more then one place but assume the first good enough 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the resource that not used should count being used 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 could block 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 one tuple and one rotation should yield one file with data 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 null acks every tuple 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 explicit delete for ephemeral node ensure this session creates the entry 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the spout must respect even some tuples have been acked but not committed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 projection 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 search all metadata strings 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this should never happen because only the primary nimbus active but just case declare the race safe even lose 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should remove the blob since cache size set really small 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 newreader true and tuple null then empty reader 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 populate user password map with jaas configuration entries from the server section usernames are distinguished from other options prefixing the username with user prefix 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 read remaining lines file then ensure lock gone 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 havent received the entire object yet return and wait for more bytes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 schedule the simple topology first 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 first offset this batch 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this tuple should removed from emitted only inside the ack method this ensure that the offsetmanager for that topicpartition updated and allows commit progression 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add element and bar should drop out 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 below calls shouldnt propagate any exceptions 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 private string timestampfield 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need able lookup bolts then switch based 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 parse the output clear the input stream buffer 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 treat like jar 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this very private and does not need exposed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 fetch records from kinesis starting sequence number for message passed argument any other messages fetched and are the failed queue will also 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 its possible for target have multiple tasks reads multiple sources 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 tests for case when subject null security turned and

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 schedule tasks that are not part components returned from topologygetspout 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 function call when timer killed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 setup const spout 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 now schedule all the topologies that need scheduled 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 critical path dont use iterators 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 good 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this default ensures things expire most past the expiration time 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this should the load metrics there will usually only one message but there are multiple only process the latest one 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should remove the second blob first 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 get close enough 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 comma separated offsets

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the short term the goal not shoot anyone unless really need the heap should limit the memory usage most cases reasonable amount someone using way more than they requested this bug and should not allow 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 for native protocol below all variables must bound with native protocol above variables can left unset which case they will ignored server side tombstones will generated

SATD	 bug grizzly needs doc root you are going register multiple adapters 
SATD	 dont need retry this operation the case failure will remove ephemeral files and dont wanna hang this process when closing cannot reconnect 
SATD	 this likely problem means that file reloading broken probably because the directory are watching was deleted otherwise became inaccessible unmounted permissions changed for now log error and exit the watcher thread 
SATD	 fixme this was originally seconds but realistically randomslowvirt hosts there way guarantee this 
SATD	 this bit weird but need return the address and the number bytes distinguish between ipv and ipv 
SATD	 not necessary repeat this expensive and not chroot related 
SATD	 bit hack but delete will never succeed and ensures that the same semantics are maintained 
SATD	 everything simply start counting the ticks warning couldnt find any wait statement synchronized block that would notified this notifyall call commented out synchronized this notifyall ping twice tick only update the tick every other 
SATD	 todoivmaykov not sure cnxn can null here becomes null channelinactive exceptioncaught trigger but its unclear usereventtriggered can run after either those check for null just safe 
SATD	 dont log error for shutdown 
SATD	 could not create tmp directory hold jaas conf file test will fail now 
SATD	 consider error 
SATD	 fixme this test assertfailing due client close race condition fixing separate patch for zookeeper this test checks see the sessionid that was created for the first zookeeper client can reused for the second one immidiately after the first client closes and the new client resues them throws ioexception throws throws keeperexception 
SATD	 does start with ipv literal 
SATD	 todo need tune the default value thread size 
SATD	 todo refactor quorumbase special case this 
SATD	 this might not right but its only used for printing connection info the netty implementation its probably 
SATD	 well catch this later does happen after timeout why waste the time poll 
SATD	 problem before fix after session close the ephemeral node was not getting deleted but now after the fix after session close 
SATD	 observer should write disk that the wont request too old txn from the leader which may lead getting entire snapshot however this may degrade performance has write disk and periodic snapshot which may double the memory requirements 
SATD	 occasionally seen false negatives with timeout 
SATD	 todo investigate why reconfig makes qps null 
SATD	 todo zksprocesspacket changed take bytebuffer could implement zerocopy queueing 
SATD	 note that this performance assumption might not hold true for architectures other than 
SATD	 note the new buffer size hint and socket implementation free ignore dont verify that get back the same value 
SATD	 todo should this synchronized 
SATD	 todo use factory rather than switch 
SATD	 xxx need anything 
SATD	 session has not been revalidated 
SATD	 sad that isro and srvr are used zookeeper itself need fix this before deprecating 
SATD	 todo need figure out the security requirement for this 
SATD	 problem follower had one extra ephemeral node 
SATD	 have read length bytes 
SATD	 todo the future serverid should validated for all cases not just the case todo however for now would too disruptive 
SATD	 since requests are processed order better get response the first request 
SATD	 this ugly you have better way speak 
SATD	 authentication error occurred during authentication with the zookeeper server 
SATD	 todo brd should either put concurrenthashmap restore use map save 
SATD	 todo this doesnt use quorum verifier 
SATD	 mocked class that doesnt clientside verification beforeafter calling removewatches 
SATD	 this shouldnt necessary wrapping data with string but without there are problems the server hangs for seconds and doesnt get the data todo investigate 
SATD	 try provide hints use about what went wrong they can fix their configuration todo introspect about look for gss information 
SATD	 fixme dont want have serialize here and then immediately deserialize next processor but not sure how else get the txn stored into our list 
SATD	 these internal classes are public but should not generally referenced 
SATD	 fixme ipv not supported using something like guavas hostandport parser would good 
SATD	 this really programmatic error and not something that can happen runtime 
SATD	 add backwards since are pushing into the front only send theres pending watch todo here have the only remaining use zookeeper this class its eliminated 
SATD	 todo rather than checking disjunction here should single member variable method this class determine whether the client configured use sasl see also zookeeper 
SATD	 todo maybe should flush the loop above every packetsbytes but how determine the right value for 
SATD	 need upgrade before can proceed 
SATD	 todo exit server this point 
SATD	 only make copy this thread isnt already holding lock 
SATD	 multiple bad arguments 
SATD	 xxx this doesnt need volatile should probably final 
SATD	 test will still fail even though just logignore 
SATD	 fixme ignore for now 
SATD	 xxx really should not need this 
SATD	 the exception thrown the server side need unwrap 
SATD	 xxx hack 
SATD	 not sure about argwhat 
SATD	 something wrong 
SATD	 fixme need way more cleanly exceptions 
SATD	 small chance that unexpected message was delivered after this check but would catch that next time 
SATD	 warning this will reset the xutil 
SATD	 little hacky way detect key type but works 
SATD	 the following sequence code stupid you would think that only sockclose needed but alas doesnt work that way you just sockclose there are cases where the socket doesnt actually close 
SATD	 todo not every tmp directory needs this file 
SATD	 xxx this shouldnt needed but just case 
SATD	 bunch constants todo will get rid eventually 
SATD	 todo can not name this method getstate since threadgetstate already exists would cleaner make class sendthread implementation runnable 
SATD	 handle below might harmless the user doesnt intend use jaas authentication 
SATD	 same for element should refactor this 
SATD	 should never call this sasl authentication negotiated session initiation todo consider substituting current implementation direct clientcnxn manipulation with call this method session initiation 
SATD	 note may exceed our max length bit when add the last watch the batch this isnt ideal but makes the code simpler

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 remove hosts number and the currently last two the list 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this simple test try connect two clients server accepting maximum one connection from each address check that only one accepted close that connection and check that the other eventually connects there possibility false positive here when tested for having connected might not have been given enough time and finish connecting after the test done since the server doesnt tell the client why hasnt connected theres obvious way detect the difference 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nonjavadoc see 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only the root path can end strip off every other prefix 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this server wasnt around during the configuration change should check that able connect finds out about the change and becomes observer

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 watcher 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 send the connection request client 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this value will used directly link codesessionmoved public static final int sessionmoved 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nonjavadoc see 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this just packet from old client which doesnt contain readonly field 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 number machines increased server the new cluster here whether move not depends the difference cluster sizes with probability oldnew the client disconnects 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this case the hostname equals literal address 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 queuedbuffer has reached its component limit combine the existing components 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check being waken closing 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 abort hit the limit 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 start mock server 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 start server again with intact database 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this shouldnt break anything 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 resolve hostname for this server case the underlying address has changed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 lets remove the leader and some other server 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 throw error there were any leaked buffers 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 delete till you can find node with more than one child 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 shutdown leader quorum should still exist 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nonjavadoc javautillist 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 election instance 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 tgt not bother with ticket management 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 each watcher will process the event 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 restart the previous leader force replay the edits and possibly come bad state 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 shutdown followers that leader does not have majority and goes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make sure they joined the new config without any change 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 where the packet actually sent 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 write message 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 get each logger from the logj repository and add the hierarchy mbean created above 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 send snap 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 different larger version dynamic file 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 start the server automatically create the necessary directories and capture the directory where data stored 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 look for the clients finish their create operations 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 default constructor 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 later 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 startforwarding will called all cases 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 send ping request either time due packet sent out within maxsendpinginterval 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 some the operations will executed client connected the removed server while others are invoked client connected some other server when were removing the leader will the client connected removed server 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 again the user explicitly set something saslrelated they probably expected sasl succeed 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 content preserved 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check avoid startup follows shutdown 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 sleep for millisecond and then again check 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check the existence name bean 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 when local session upgrading disabled leader will reject the ephemeral node creation due session expire however this the follower that issue the request will have the correct error code should use that and report user 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only called callback from 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the test failes will most likely fail with noauth exception before ever gets this assertion 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 loop through the args must keyvalue sequence 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 falls back filename detection property value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 start the followers form new quorum 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 number machines became smaller server not the new cluster 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the node value same what have leader 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check that the static config was split into static and dynamic files correctly 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 nonjavadoc see eventeventtype javalangstring 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 signal for graceful shutdown 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 proceed the next processor 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 cleanup 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 halt one the listeners and verify count 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 throttle when there are too many concurrent snapshots being sent observers 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should only happen during upgrade 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check for any parent that has been quota 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 take one the new servers possible there are still such servers didnt try and either the probability tells connect one the new servers already tried all the old servers 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 wont race another upgrade attempt because only one thread will get the timeout from the map 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 findbugs complains about get after put long term strategy would use computeifabsent after jdk 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 jaasconf entry available 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 create the node with another session 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the node doesnt exist anymore skip 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 sid 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the first allowable character 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 during first and second iteration leavingindex will correspond follower during third and fouth iteration leavingindex will the index 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the socket times out count that assertfailed

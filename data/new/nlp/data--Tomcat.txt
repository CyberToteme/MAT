SATD	 filter that attempts force webdav clients connecting port use webdav client that actually works other workarounds that might help include lispecifying the port even port when trying connectli licancelling the first authentication dialog box and then trying reconnectli generally each different version the client has different set problems todo update this filter recognise specific clients and apply the appropriate workarounds for that particular client filter this configured webxml like any other filter you usually want map this filter whatever your webdav servlet mapped addition the issues fixed this filter the following issues have also been observed that cannot fixed this filter where possible the filter will add message the logs miniredir version lionly connects port liunknown issue means doesnt workli 
SATD	 todo close may block the remote endpoint doesnt read the data eventually there will timeoutexception however this method sendmessage intended run asynchronous code and shouldnt block otherwise would temporarily stop processing messages from other clients maybe call this method another thread note that when this method called the remoteendpointasync still the process sending data there probably should another way abort the websocket connection ideally there should some abort method that cancels the connection immediately 
SATD	 the setting iselignored changes the behaviour the parser subtle ways add the fun iselignored can set any file that forms part the translation unit setting file included towards the end the translation unit can change how the parser should have behaved when parsing content the point where iselignored was set arghh previous attempts hack around this have only provided partial solutions now use two passes parse the translation unit the first just parses the directives and the second parses the whole translation unit once know how iselignored has been set todo there are some possible optimisations this process

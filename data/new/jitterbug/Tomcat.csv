(See also section 6.1.5 [of the CGI specification].) * </p> * [end excerpt] * * <h2> Implementation notes</h2> * <p> * * <b>standard input handling</b>: If your script accepts standard input * then the client must start sending input within a certain timeout period * otherwise the servlet will assume no input is coming and carry on running * the script.  The script's the standard input will be closed and handling of * any further input from the client is undefined.  Most likely it will be * ignored.  If this behavior becomes undesirable then this servlet needs * to be enhanced to handle threading of the spawned process' stdin stdout * and stderr (which should not be too hard). * <br> * If you find your cgi scripts are timing out receiving input you can set * the init parameter <code>stderrTimeout</code> of your webapps' cgi-handling * servlet. * </p> * <p> * * <b>Metavariable Values</b>: According to the CGI specification * implementations may choose to represent both null or missing values in an * implementation-specific manner but must define that manner.  This * implementation chooses to always define all required metavariables but * set the value to "" for all metavariables whose value is either null or * undefined.  PATH_TRANSLATED is the sole exception to this rule as per the * CGI Specification. * * </p> * <p> * * <b>NPH --  Non-parsed-header implementation</b>:  This implementation does * not support the CGI NPH concept whereby server ensures that the data * supplied to the script are precisely as supplied by the client and * unaltered by the server. * </p> * <p> * The function of a servlet container (including Tomcat) is specifically * designed to parse and possible alter CGI-specific variables and as * such makes NPH functionality difficult to support. * </p> * <p> * The CGI specification states that compliant servers MAY support NPH output. * It does not state servers MUST support NPH output to be unconditionally * compliant.  Thus this implementation maintains unconditional compliance * with the specification though NPH support is not present. * </p> * <p> * * The CGI specification is located at * <a href="http://cgi-spec.golux.com">http://cgi-spec.golux.com</a>. * * </p> * <h3>TODO:</h3> * <ul> * <li> Support for setting headers (for example Location headers don't work) * <li> Support for collapsing multiple header lines (per RFC 2616) * <li> Ensure handling of POST method does not interfere with 2.3 Filters * <li> Refactor some debug code out of core * <li> Ensure header handling preserves encoding * <li> Possibly rewrite CGIRunner.run()? * <li> Possibly refactor CGIRunner and CGIEnvironment as non-inner classes? * <li> Document handling of cgi stdin when there is no stdin * <li> Revisit IOException handling in CGIRunner.run() * <li> Better documentation * <li> Confirm use of ServletInputStream.available() in CGIRunner.run() is *      not needed * <li> [add more to this TODO list] * </ul> * * @author Martin T Dengler [root@martindengler.com] * @author Amy Roh  */

The loop below handles 0 1 or 2 stream being blocked   - If 0 streams are blocked the connection window will be set to one     and that will be consumed by the first stream to attempt to write.     That body frame will be read by the client. The stream will then be     blocked and the loop will start again.   - If 1 stream is blocked the connection window will be set to one     which will then be consumed by the blocked stream. After writing     the single byte the stream will again be blocked and the loop will     start again.   - If 2 streams are blocked the connection window will be set to one     but one byte will be permitted for both streams (due to rounding in     the allocation). The window size should be -1 (see below). Two     frames (one for each stream will be written) one of which will be     consumed by the client. The loop will start again and the Window     size incremented to zero. No data will be written by the streams     but the second data frame written in the last iteration of the loop     will be read.

In this case: *     <ul> *     <li>The <code>userSearch</code> pattern specifies the search filter *         after substitution of the username.</li> *     <li>The <code>userBase</code> property can be set to the element that *         is the base of the subtree containing users.

This method is used when the <code>userPassword</code> *     property is specified in which case: *     <ul> *     <li>The element for this user must contain an attribute named by the *         <code>userPassword</code> property. *     <li>The value of the user password attribute is either a cleartext *         String or the result of passing a cleartext String through the *         <code>RealmBase.digest()</code> method (using the standard digest *         support included in <code>RealmBase</code>). *     <li>The user is considered to be authenticated if the presented *         credentials (after being passed through *         <code>RealmBase.digest()</code>) are equal to the retrieved value *         for the user password attribute.</li> *     </ul></li> * * <li>Each group of users that has been assigned a particular role may be *     represented by an individual element in the top level *     <code>DirContext</code> that is accessed via the *     <code>connectionURL</code> property.

If not specified *         the entire context will be searched.</li> *     <li>The <code>roleSubtree</code> property can be set to *         <code>true</code> if you wish to search the entire subtree of the *         directory context.  The default value of <code>false</code> *         requests a search of only the current level.</li> *     <li>The element includes an attribute (whose name is configured by *         the <code>roleName</code> property) containing the name of the *         role represented by this element.</li> *     </ul></li> * * <li>In addition roles may be represented by the values of an attribute * in the user's element whose name is configured by the * <code>userRoleName</code> property.</li> * * <li>A default role can be assigned to each user that was successfully * authenticated by setting the <code>commonRole</code> property to the * name of this role.

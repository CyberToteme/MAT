SATD	  really dont like this the xml processor still too involved the processing better solution imo would create for project and target too and then process the tree and have projecttarget deal with its attributes similar with description eventually switch add support for dom things will work smoothly can avoided almost completely could still created demand for backward compatibility 
SATD	 junit wraps solo tests this way can extract the original test name with little  
SATD	  ignore attributes different maybe store them 
SATD	 borrowed from tokenfiltertest 
SATD	  move project shared all helpers 
SATD	 what the property supposed 
SATD	  for anttype value anttype component name which can namespaced need extract the name and convert from qualified name uriname 
SATD	 theres convenient xsltc class version but data are private use package information 
SATD	 stolen from the xercesj team which ascii characters need escaped 
SATD	 bingo append this should normally not done here 
SATD	 this faintly ridiculous 
SATD	 cannot remove underscores due protected visibility 
SATD	  not read yet public setter 
SATD	 not know what the object class has multiple defines but this for logging only 
SATD	 not sure what could the need this 
SATD	  jon skeet any reason for writing message and then using bare runtimeexception rather than just using buildexception here case the message could end being written loggers the loggers could have failed created due this failure 
SATD	 experimentaltesting will removed 
SATD	  should instead make new protectiondomain with codesource corresponding containertouritourl and the same had 
SATD	 this really irritating need way set stuff 
SATD	  all this convert source destination directory according weblogic standards can written better this too y 
SATD	 silly  avoid stack overflow 
SATD	 access property tables this used support ant call and similar tasks should deprecated possible use better more efficient mechanism preserve the context 
SATD	  should throw exception instead 
SATD	 temporary until figure better api 
SATD	 there better way save the context this shouldnt delegate next its for backward compatibility only 
SATD	 quick fix for antjava use property before initializing the project 
SATD	  should use jcvs wwwicecomjcvs instead command line execution that dont rely having native cvs stuff around 
SATD	 two reasons are mentioned the api docs for filelist dir not directory this impossible wouldnt get here this case error occurred why doesnt throw exception then 
SATD	 jakarta commons logging listener note not use the simplelog your logger implementation causes infinite loop since writes systemerr which ant traps and reroutes the loggerlistener layer the following names are used for the log for project events for target events for events individual targets all target and project names replace and with  should use the advanced context logging features and expose them first  this very inefficient switching the out and tracking the logs can optimized lot but may require few more changes the core since ant 
SATD	  using taskname here brittle user could override this should probably modified use the classname instead 
SATD	 these are pathological cases but retained case somebody subclassed 
SATD	 this rather hairy case one our subclasses knows that need update the archive but the same time there are resources known that would need added only the subclass seems know whats going this happens jar detects that the manifest has changed for example the manifest not part any resources because our support for inline manifests invoke createemptyzip like ant did well loose all stuff that has been the original archive bugzilla report 
SATD	 this deprecated use classespath the future 
SATD	  this array stuff remnant prev trials gotta remove 
SATD	 set the number milliseconds leeway give before deciding target out date  this not yet used param granularity the granularity used decide target out date 
SATD	 this may change add advanced parsing capabilities 
SATD	 assume that every output jikes does stands for errorwarning  this correct 
SATD	 the line below  the system must uri but not cleat get the uri resource just set the name the resource system 
SATD	  what the following doing should run javadoc executable null 
SATD	 mac and previous  have idea how get someone must fix 
SATD	  nothing appears read this but set using public setter 
SATD	  are committing combiningchar and extender here 
SATD	  failed load the class properly should print warning here 
SATD	  could perhaps also call threadstop not sure anyone cares 
SATD	  perhaps shouldnt use properties for these three options emacs mode warnings and pedantic but include the javac directive 
SATD	  maybe use reflection addpathelement other patterns 
SATD	  there problem with the constructor for the rbc you have provide the rules the constructors setters available 
SATD	 probably not the best choice but solves the problem relative paths classpath 
SATD	 fix for invalid characters you think more add the list 
SATD	 fallback case have trouble loading the class dont know how handle there easy way know what idl mode would generate this supposed make ant always recompile the class file that name should not exist 
SATD	 check out also ugly 
SATD	 cant get head around this encoding treatment needed here 
SATD	 quick dirty make nested mapped psets work 
SATD	  this code still necessary there any port pull zip from packages directory 
SATD	 only the developer knows what she doing 
SATD	  unfortunately jdk adds entryset keyset values implementing this requires small  can add later 
SATD	 first developer could use little help 
SATD	  should silently catch possible exceptions and try load different implementation 
SATD	 since java return normalizedpathsplit workaround for java 
SATD	 hammer end inline maingtu 
SATD	 this array really shouldnt here again for historical purposes p this array should private package private location since could modified malicious codep 
SATD	 should move separate public class and have api add listeners etc 
SATD	 should become single empty argument same for 
SATD	 not very nice but will the job 
SATD	 provide public visibility 
SATD	 not used but public theoretically must remain for 
SATD	 dont want call this method 
SATD	  what this for 
SATD	 keep this have something delete later tests 
SATD	 copied from concattest 
SATD	 not sure whether this clean but this method declared not throw exceptions 
SATD	 just set the prefix for this fileset and pass need this 
SATD	 why nothing 
SATD	 have deal with assembly the programmer can writing little byte chunks for all know and must assemble complete records for writing review maybe this should tarbuffer could that help eliminate some the buffer copying 
SATD	 this the new better way use classespath instead sourcespath the code currently the same you need class files directory use this jar files 
SATD	  why not simply new filedir filename 
SATD	 this ugly checking for the root folder 
SATD	  parameterise call compiler class dont want fork again use classic compiler can parameterised 
SATD	  all this get package according weblogic standards can written better this too y careful similar code scandir but slightly different 
SATD	 stolen from writemanifest 
SATD	 the jarfile already exists then w and recreate should probably think more elegant way handle this that case errors dont leave people worse off than when started 
SATD	  the following really necessary the same thread group 
SATD	 have find cleaner way put this output 
SATD	 this the old way and deprecated classespath the right way this and above 
SATD	 for script example that modifies ided tasks other targets work very ugly the reference replaced runtimeconfigurable 
SATD	 dont call superclose because that reader used other places 
SATD	 report error something weird happensthis diagnostic 
SATD	 sorry otherwise will get classcastexception because the mockcache loaded two different classloader 
SATD	  ask the create instance voluntarily providing illegal arguments force the run the class static initializer while the same time not running valid constructor 
SATD	 singleton for now may change perclassloader 
SATD	  shouldnt this always return false isolated mode 
SATD	 delete the file not valid file 
SATD	  comment field doesnt include all options yet 
SATD	 this method checks the timestamp each file listed the code ejbfilescode and compares them the timestamp the codejarfile code the codejarfilecodes timestamp more recent than each ejb file codetruecode returned otherwise codefalse code returned  find way check the manifestfile that found naming convention param ejbfiles hashtable ejb classes and other files that will added the completed jar file param jarfile jar file which will contain all the ejb classes and other files return boolean indicating whether not the codejarfilecode date 
SATD	 have think about lazy initialization here jhm comparator new 
SATD	  methods yet for getclassname  method for newinstance using reverseclassloader 
SATD	 the displayname variable stores the value the displayname element from the standard ejb descriptor future enhancement this task may determine the name the ejb jar file using this displayname but this has not implemented yet 
SATD	 output stream that compresses into the bzip format without the file header chars into another stream pthe compression requires large amounts memory thus you should call the link close close method soon possible force release the allocated memoryp pyou can shrink the amount allocated memory and maybe raise the compression speed choosing lower blocksize which turn may cause lower compression ratio you can avoid unnecessary memory allocation avoiding using blocksize which bigger than the size the input pyou can compute the memory usage for compressing the following formulap pre codek blocksizecode pre pto get the memory required for decompression link cbzipinputstream cbzipinputstream usep pre codek blocksizecode pre table width border colgroup col width col width col width colgroup colspanmemory usage blocksizeth trtr usageth usageth trtr alignrightktd alignrightktd alignright ktd trtr alignrightktd alignrightktd alignrightktd trtr alignrightktd alignrightktd alignrightktd trtr alignrightktd alignrightktd alignrightktd trtr alignrightktd alignrightktd alignrightktd trtr alignrightktd alignrightktd alignrightktd trtr alignrightktd alignrightktd alignrightktd trtr alignrightktd alignrightktd alignrightktd trtr alignrightktd alignrightktd alignrightktd table pfor decompression allocates less memory the bzipped input smaller than one blockp pinstances this class are not threadsafep  update bzip 
SATD	  log error throw exception 
SATD	  allow user request the system parent 
SATD	 there was any text before this add fragment  this check could modified posprev seems like this current version could stick empty strings into the list

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 interestingly enough get here when user uses dnamevalue however some cases the goes ahead and parses this out args dname value instead parsing just make the characters away and skip one argument forward dont know how predict when the jdk going help not simply look for the equals sign 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 special case single jar handling with signedjar attribute set 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 read the dependency cache from the disk 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not cached need read directly from the class file 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 convert the replyto string into vector emailaddresses 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 make sure buildfile exists 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should always the case 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 single jar processing 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 optional methods you can override those methods you want optimize advanced things like support special syntax the methods not chain you should use them when embedding ant replacing the main helper 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 this class depends each class the dependency list for each one those add this class into their affected classes list 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the capturetosummary test writes stdout and stderr good for verifying that the testlistener support doesnt break anything 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 now determine which jars each class depends upon 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 usually the initialized set true but here must not because the prepend and append readers have instantiated runtime 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 return here 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 also check for properly formed uris ant formerly recommended using nonsense uris such filefooxml xml includes you shouldnt that just fooxml correct but for compatibility specialcase things when the path not absolute and fall back the old parsing behavior

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 build the command line from what got the format history elements specified the ssexe help 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 there are places this file and perhaps elsewhere where assumed that null acceptable parameter 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 just call the and let handle the semantics instantiation retrieval 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 converted from sun internal classes new baseconverter utility class extracted from get task 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 further methods necessary this just amalgamation two other interfaces 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 copying dirs trivial and can done for nonfile resources well for real files 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the singleton 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 simplest case setattribute expects string 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use the logger config 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only default specified and the property did not exist the property file the property set default 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 had child elements need indent before close the element otherwise were the same line and dont need indent 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the key the dictionary but cannot retrieved this usually due references that refer tasks that have not been taskdefed the current run ignore 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 value and default are both specified and the property previously existed the property file the property set value 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 write magic done caller who created this stream thisoutwriteb thisoutwritez 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 since task log category includes target dont really need this message 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 property type operations 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 crc mode sizdev uid gid 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 property types 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 keys used properties 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 target file exptected string 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 mandatory constructor 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 resetting the stylesheet reset transformer 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need reset templates well 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 driver doesnt understand the url 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 its task append the target 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 set parameters each transformation maybe something has changed value file name parameter 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 doesnt make sense for use the logger config 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check that suite generates errors 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 could not get the required information 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 are any other references held can close the loader removes the locks jars new one will created 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 finally assign the property with the manifest classpath 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 refresh attribute case multivalued attributes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 execute the get 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 set the timestamp the file date 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 webxml file specified its error 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 neither 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check that having suite generates errors 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use wrappers for primitive classes int and integer are treated identically 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 one cannot rmic interface for classic rmi jrmp 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 manifests classpath attribute always uses forward slashes and spaceseparated ant will properly format columns with proper line continuation 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not use the sun impl for portability and always use our own implementation for consistent testing 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 otherwise perform timestamp comparison least 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 move the generated source file the base directory base directory and sourcebase are the same the generated sources are already place 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 revisit this point even non http connections may support the ifmodifiedsince behaviour just check the date the content and skip the write not newer some protocols ftp dont include dates course 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 source file generated nothing move 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the property the name file are testing location attribute need resolve the given file name the provided folder 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the method called addcreate the nested element 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check that invalid suite generates error 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 check create this property already present add takes preference over create for purposes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not the requested type 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 dont think can use file different rules for relative paths 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 fullpathname specified path list simple name specified path list 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 helper cannot found the helper for another classloader create new 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 only get here exception has been thrown 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 whether not this processdestroyer has been registered shutdown hook 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 asserttruereturn code invalid retcode retcode 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 junit test runnergetretcode 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 ignore attribute from unknown uris 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 not initialized yet create the factory 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 specific attributes for the transformer 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 need load task via system classloader the new task want define will never task but always wrapped into taskadapter 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 kept for backwards compatibility 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 configure factory attributes 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the rest the method treats single jar like nested path with one file 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 use xmlcatalog the entity resolver and uri resolver 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 configure output properties 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 process the processor options 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 jvc doesnt support bootclasspath dir bootclasspath well emulate for compatibility and convenience 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 new versions java come out add them this test 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 copy the properties file 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 load properties from file specified otherwise use ants properties 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 add configured replaces the add method 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 should print panic cannot find importvocab file javatokentypestxt since needs run javag first before javatreeg 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 found the property set its good 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 java the modern falls back classic not found but java just bail out early 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 output properties 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 create task set this task the default one 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 build the command line from what got the format ccm files specified the ccmexe help 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 the sos class knows that the sos server needs the password flag even there password send 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	 get random number between and the number files
